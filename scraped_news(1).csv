"GM, Canadian union reach tentative agreement, ending strike",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/canadian-union-unifor-strike-three-gm-facilities-2023-10-10/,"OSHAWA, Ontario, Oct 10 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM.N) and Canadian union Unifor reached a tentative agreement on Tuesday just hours after 4,300 workers went on strike at three GM facilities. The union said the tentative agreement follows the pattern agreement Unifor reached with Ford Motor (F.N) last month and includes wage hikes of up to 25%. The strike ended after about 12 hours in which it had threatened the largest U.S. automaker's profitable full-size truck production. Workers must still vote to approve the agreement. “When faced with the shutdown of these key facilities General Motors had no choice but to get serious at the table and agree to the pattern,"" said Unifor National President Lana Payne. She added that GM agreed to items it initially fought including ""pensions, retiree income supports and converting full-time temporary workers into permanent employees over the life of the agreement."" The agreement will cut the time needed to get to top pay from eight years to four years, Payne said, which is important since there are so many younger GM Canadian workers. ""It’s great for the workers, but we’re not out of the water yet because we still have to ratify this agreement,"" said GM worker Darrell Colley, standing outside the Oshawa plant after the agreement was reached. GM shares closed up 1.6%. The company said work resumed at all three facilities in the afternoon and that the deal ""recognizes the many contributions of our represented team members with significant increases in wages, benefits and job security."" The walkout by workers early on Tuesday came after Unifor said GM was ""stubbornly refusing"" to match the contract the labor union reached with Ford. The walkout was set to intensify the headache faced by the automaker in the U.S. where it is racking up millions of dollars in daily losses to the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike that started Sept. 15. GM has lost 34,176 vehicles of production since the start of the UAW strike, according to an estimate by Deutsche Bank. The automaker said last week it had 442,586 vehicles in stock. The UAW has struck two GM assembly plants in the United States and 18 parts distribution centers. GM has laid off 2,300 U.S. workers due to the impacts of the UAW strike. Unifor has used the ""pattern bargaining"" approach in its talks, reaching a deal first with Ford. The union said GM will now follow the pattern. The UAW, on the other hand, broke with that approach under its new leadership. Payne said Stellantis (STLAM.MI) workers deserve the same agreement but expected the company ""will come here kicking and screaming the way that General Motors did."" Stellantis declined to comment. Unifor represents about 18,000 Canadian workers at Ford, GM and Chrysler parent Stellantis. Separately, the UAW said Tuesday that 97% of General Dynamics (GD.N) manufacturing workers in Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania voted to authorize a strike. The contract covering 1,100 defense industry workers expires on Oct. 22. On Monday, about 4,000 UAW workers at Volvo Group (VOLVb.ST)-owned Mack Trucks went on strike after overwhelmingly rejecting a proposed five-year contract. About 73% of the unit's 4,000 workers in Pennsylvania, Florida and Maryland voted against the deal that included a 19% pay raise. Unions have increasingly resorted to strikes across sectors from airlines to automakers, buoyed by a tight labor market and positive public opinion in the U.S., even though union membership has fallen."
Union at Kia Corp suspends strike action to resume talks with company,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/kia-corps-unionised-workers-go-partial-strike-over-wages-union-2023-10-11/,"SEOUL, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Kia Corp's (000270.KS) union in South Korea said it would suspend for now a partial strike announced earlier on Wednesday to pursue more talks with the company. The union and Kia's management had been holding talks for three months over wage increases and an extension of the retirement age. Earlier, the union said it would limit working hours for six working days from Oct. 12 after negotiations stalled, in what would have been the first industrial action at Kia in three years. ""We have decided to put a pause on the planned strike for tomorrow as we are having negotiations with the management,"" an official at the Kia union told Reuters, adding that the union would decide the next step after talks with the company. Kia declined to comment on the industrial action. The Kia union is seeking a minimum basic monthly pay increase of 184,900 won ($138.12), a performance pay equating to 30% of Kia's 2022 net profit as well as an increase to the retirement age to 64 from 60 and a 4-day work week. Last month, the union at South Korea's second largest automaker with more than 26,600 members said 92.3% of its members had approved strike action unless the management accepts their demands. The labour action at Kia comes as the union at affiliate Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) avoided a strike after the union and the management last month sealed a deal set to boost annual pay by about 12%. Because the deals with Hyundai Motor and affiliate Hyundai Mobis (012330.KS) were concluded without any industrial action, Kia's unions are likely to avoid any major industrial action, analysts said. ""For now, Kia is the only one that plans to go on an actual strike... this is unlikely to give much momentum for Kia to carry intense strikes or go on for too long by itself,"" said Lee Jae-il, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities. Shares in Kia Corp closed up 0.5%, versus the benchmark KOSPI's (.KS11) 2% rise."
US SEC shortens deadline to disclose 5% stock ownership to 5 days,https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-sec-shortens-stock-disclosure-deadline-5-days-2023-10-10/,"Oct 10 (Reuters) - Wall Street's top regulator on Tuesday said it has tightened the timeline for investors to disclose 5% ownership stakes in companies they intend to control, shortening the allowed window from 10 calendar days to five business days. The five-member U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission voted 4-1 to adopt the changes. Officials said this marked an update to half-century-old regulations that had not kept pace with advances in market technology. ""In our fast-paced markets, it shouldn't take 10 days for the public to learn about an attempt to change or influence control of a public company,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement. The SEC proposal, first made public in 2022, initially angered some activist investors who claimed that having to step forward sooner could make it unprofitable to build the ownership positions they need for successful takeover campaigns. The SEC is also currently seeking to force Tesla CEO Elon Musk to give evidence in the agency's investigation of his takeover of the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, in which officials say Musk may have made such disclosures late. As adopted, the rule also shortens the disclosure deadline for certain institutional investors to 45 days from the end of the quarter in which their ownership stake surpasses 5%. Previously, the deadline was 45 days from the end of the calendar year. In advance of the announcement, SEC officials told reporters the final rule had been softened in important ways from the original proposal. It had initially called for investors seeking control of a company to reveal within five calendar days, rather than business days, that they have purchased 5% or more of a company's shares. Additionally, the initial proposal would have required certain institutional investors -- meaning companies that make bulk investments on behalf of others such as pension funds -- to disclose stakes of 5% or more within five business days from a month's end, rather than 45 days from the end of the quarter. The SEC announced the new rule changes after they had already been adopted rather than through a public meeting. Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce, the lone objector, said the change effectively required investors who expend considerable effort and resources in researching stock purchases to tip off other investors who have not, weakening the incentive for markets to monitor corporate conduct. ""This 'modernization' effort might better be characterized as an insulation effort -- insulating corporate managers from scrutiny,"" Peirce said in a statement."
"Tesla rejects union claims, reports of health and safety issues at German plant",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-rejects-union-claims-reports-health-safety-issues-german-plant-2023-10-10/,"BERLIN, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) on Tuesday rejected claims by a German union and recent media reports that health and safety provisions at its gigafactory near Berlin were inadequate, stating that protecting workers' health was a top priority. The U.S. electric vehicle maker came under scrutiny in the past fortnight after German media citing local authority documents in Brandenburg reported an unusually high number of work-related accidents requiring workers to take at least three days of sick leave were occurring at the plant, which employs around 11,000 workers. The report detailed accidents that included serious injuries such as burns, hydrochloric acid or amputated limbs. On Monday, German union IG Metall said its membership numbers from Tesla workers were rising steeply amid concerns over health and safety as well as overwork. Reuters was not able to independently verify the union's claims or the media report. In a written statement, Tesla said workers received training on necessary safety measures, as well as protective clothing. The plant was subject to regular checks by local authorities that safety measures were being respected, it added. The company did not address the specific claims of the union or media reports regarding the number of accidents or workers off sick at the plant. Reuters spoke to twelve workers at the factory on Monday. While four said they were satisfied with working conditions, eight said pressure for speed was too high, with some reporting high incidence of accidents and issues with receiving overtime pay. Brandenburg's authority on occupational safety and health said to Reuters it only held records of serious accidents at work resulting in over six weeks of inpatient treatment or permanent physical damage, of which there had been six at the Tesla plant in 2021 and 2022. The authority's staff conducted weekly safety checks at the plant during its construction phase and now visited fortnightly, with unannounced checks every 6-8 weeks, it added."
Top issues in Detroit Three's negotiations with UAW,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/top-issues-detroit-threes-negotiations-with-uaw-2023-10-10/,"Oct 10 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) secured a ""major breakthrough"" in labor talks with the Detroit Three automakers as General Motors (GM.N) made some concessions by allowing workers at joint-venture battery plants to be covered by union contracts. Here is a look at the top talking points, and how negotiations have progressed three weeks after the strike began, according to UAW President Shawn Fain and the companies: Source: Fain's statement, company statements"
"From Detroit Three to healthcare, US labor unions flex muscle",https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/detroit-three-healthcare-us-labor-unions-flex-muscle-2023-10-10/,"Oct 10 (Reuters) - A tight U.S. labor market, the expiry of union contracts and high living costs have led to tough negotiations for pay hikes and benefits, triggering strikes and protests across industries. Nearly 309,700 workers have been involved in work stoppages and strikes through August this year, according to preliminary data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, putting 2023 on track to becoming the busiest year for strikes since 2019. Here are some sectors and companies that faced tough negotiations in 2023: Members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) approved a new three-year contract with major studios on Oct. 9. Film and television writers had walked off the job in May over compensation, staffing and residual payments, among other issues. They went back to work on Sept. 27 after negotiators reached a tentative agreement. In July, the SAG-AFTRA actors union joined the writers on picket lines, and it remains on strike. Negotiators for striking Hollywood actors met with representatives of major studios, television networks and streaming services this week and said negotiations will resume on Oct. 11. The United Auto Workers (UAW) union has expanded its ongoing strike against the Detroit Three automakers - General Motors (GM.N), Ford Motor (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI). The coordinated strike, which began after the earlier contracts expired on Sept. 15, initially targeted three assembly plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri. Union workers at Volvo Group (VOLVb.ST)-owned Mack Trucks went on strike on Oct. 9 after overwhelmingly rejecting a proposed five-year contract. Teamsters union workers at United Parcel Service (UPS.N) ratified a new five-year contract in August, a deal that raises pay, eliminates a two-tier wage system for drivers, provides another paid holiday and ends forced overtime. FedEx (FDX.N) pilots have been involved in a standoff with the parcel delivery firm over wages and legacy pensions. Pilots rejected a tentative deal in July and negotiations are expected to restart. Pilots at several airlines including American Airlines (AAL.O), Delta Airlines (DAL.N), United Airlines Holdings (UAL.O), Spirit Airlines (SAVE.N) and Jetblue Airways (JBLU.O) negotiated new job contracts this year. Members of some unions like the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association have voted to authorize a strike if a new contract is not reached. Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N) negotiated a new contract to end a strike that led to a week-long work stoppage at its plant in Wichita, Kansas. U.S. steel producer Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF.N) has reached a tentative agreement with the United Steelworkers union on a new three-year labor agreement for its Northshore mining operations. U.S. Steel (X.N), which is reviewing multiple proposals ranging from partial acquisition to an entire buyout, is embroiled in a tussle with the United Steelworkers union. The company's unionized workers say they essentially have the power to veto any transaction they do not approve of. Thousands of Las Vegas workers will picket in front of eight MGM Resorts (MGM.N) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR.O) resort locations on Thursday. Unions representing the roughly 53,000 Las Vegas workers met last week with MGM, Caesars and Wynn Resorts (WYNN.O) over a new five-year contract. In September, workers at three Detroit casinos - MGM Grand Detroit, Hollywood at Greektown and MotorCity - voted in favor of authorizing a strike at all three locations if a new contract agreement isn't reached. The Detroit Casino Council (DCC), which represents the workers, could call for strikes as soon as mid-October, when contracts expire. More than 3,000 workers at more than 150 Starbucks (SBUX.O) stores in the U.S. held strikes in June, following claims the company had banned Pride Month decorations at some of its cafes.  read more   read more  Thousands of Los Angeles-area hotel staffers went on a three-day strike in July over improved wages, benefits and working conditions. Union leaders representing the workers have threatened further walkouts. The Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions has served the company notice that a week-long ""follow-up strike is possible"" starting Nov. 1 unless a settlement is reached beforehand. Tens of thousands of nurses and other healthcare workers at Kaiser Permanente staged a planned three-day strike last week over pay and staffing issues. More than 7,000 nurses went on a three-day strike in New York City over staffing levels and pay hikes in January. Unions representing cannabis workers have also increased pressure on companies in the sector this year. Workers at Green Thumb Industries' (GTII.CD) Chicago-area RISE dispensaries went on a 13-day unfair labor practices (ULP) strike in April, which was the longest ULP strike at a cannabis retailer in U.S. history. Labor unions secured new contract agreements at multistate operator-owned cannabis dispensaries in Illinois and in New Jersey in July. Unionized workers at Phillips 66's (PSX.N) refinery in Roxana, Illinois, ratified a contract with the refiner in late-stage negotiations, averting a potential strike. The union had been in talks with the refiner since summer, when it rejected a company proposal and sought additional benefits for holiday and vacation hours and pay, among other improvements."
UAW workers strike Mack Trucks after rejecting contract,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-workers-reject-mack-trucks-contract-will-strike-2023-10-09/,"Oct 9 (Reuters) - Union workers at Volvo Group (VOLVb.ST)-owned Mack Trucks went on strike on Monday after overwhelmingly rejecting a proposed five-year contract, the United Auto Workers said, the latest tentative labor agreement in the U.S. to be voted down. About 73% of the unit's 4,000 workers in Pennsylvania, Florida and Maryland voted against the deal that included a 19% pay raise, said the UAW, which is in the midst of contract talks with Detroit's Big Three automakers. Ford Motor (F.N) in those talks has offered a 23% wage hike. The proposed Mack deal had also included a $3,500 ratification bonus, improved retirement benefits, additional vacation for some employees and a reduction in the time needed to get to top pay. In online forums, some Mack workers complained the raise was too small to keep up with inflation. “We don't see ourselves as disconnected from the struggle of the Big Three,"" said Will Lehman, a material technician who works at Mack's Lehigh Valley facility in Pennsylvania. He added that he was displeased that the UAW endorsed a ""phony"" tentative agreement to be voted on. The cost of living had gone up more than the 19% Mack offer, Lehman said. UAW President Shawn Fain, who had backed the Mack deal, said late on Sunday: ""I'm inspired to see UAW members at Mack holding out for a better deal, and ready to stand up and walk off the job to win it."" Mack President Stephen Roy said the company was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the strike. Mack ""clearly demonstrated our commitment to good-faith bargaining by arriving at a tentative agreement that was endorsed by both the International UAW and the UAW Mack Truck Council,"" Roy added. Mack, which was bought by Volvo in 2000, is one of North America's largest makers of medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks. The UAW said it would contact Mack to set dates to resume bargaining. ""UAW members and workers across the economy are mobilizing to demand their fair share,"" the UAW said in a letter to Mack. ""The union remains committed to exploring all options for reaching an agreement, but clearly we are not there yet."" Unions negotiating new contracts in the auto, shipping and healthcare industries have used labor actions to keep employers off-balance this year. Polls have shown most Americans broadly support the unions' demands. In the last 12 months, freight rail workers and employees at shipping company FedEx (FDX.N) have rejected tentative agreements between union negotiators and companies before eventually reaching deals. The UAW has been on a targeted strike against facilities of the Detroit Three automakers since Sept. 15. About 25,000 of the 146,000 UAW employees at General Motors (GM.N), Ford and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) are on strike. Fain said on Friday the union would not expand the strikes, citing progress in talks. Canadian workers at GM also face a contract talk deadline at midnight on Monday (0400 GMT on Tuesday) that could lead to another strike. Stellantis said on Monday it was furloughing another 570 workers in Michigan and Indiana, bringing the total to 640, citing the impacts of the UAW strike, specifically storage constraints. GM said it was boosting its layoffs by about 200 to 2,300, while Ford said it was furloughing another 70 employees in Michigan as a result of the strike, raising the total to 1,865. GM's revised offer did not match the 23% pay raise proposed by Ford. On Friday, the UAW said GM agreed that workers at joint venture battery plants could be covered by union contracts, but GM offered no details on Monday. On Monday, Deutsche Bank estimated GM has lost 34,176 vehicles of production during the strike, Ford 21,296 vehicles and Stellantis 18,893 vehicles, reducing total Detroit Three earnings by $946 million to date. Mexico's auto parts industry is expected to register a $412 million hit to production by Friday, a trade group said on Monday. Anderson Economic Group estimates a total economic loss of $5.5 billion through the third full week of the strike, including in lost wages, $2.68 billion in automaker losses, $1.6 billion for suppliers and $1.26 billion in dealer and customer losses."
US automakers increase strike layoffs by more than 800,https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/gm-expands-strike-layoffs-by-nearly-200-workers-2023-10-09/,"Oct 9 (Reuters) - Chrysler-parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) said on Monday it is laying off another 570 workers and General Motors (GM.N) announced cuts of nearly 200 employee due to the United Auto Workers strike. Ford said Monday another 70 workers had been laid off in Michigan, bringing the total at the automaker to 1,865 since the strike began. There are a total of 640 workers at Stellantis that have been laid off. Stellantis, which has had a total of 640 layoffs, said the latest include 520 at its Trenton, Michigan engine plant as well as 50 at an Indiana casting plant. Stellantis said the layoffs were due to storage constraints. GM increased its layoffs by 200 to 2,300, affecting six plants including its Lansing, Michigan, stamping plant and a Toledo, Ohio, plant. GM said workers are not expected to return until the strike is resolved. The strike began Sept. 15."
Analysis: Why Elon Musk might lose his latest battle with the SEC over Twitter probe,https://www.reuters.com/business/why-sec-might-win-its-latest-battle-with-elon-musk-2023-10-09/,"WASHINGTON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken Elon Musk to court again, and this time it may win. The agency on Thursday asked a federal court to force Musk to testify for its investigation into his $44 billion takeover of social media giant Twitter, the third time the SEC has taken Musk to court. It sued him in 2018 and again in 2019 in relation to a tweet Musk sent saying that he had funding secured to take his electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA.O) private. The 2018 lawsuit was quickly settled on the condition that lawyers vet Musk's future tweets. The 2019 lawsuit by the SEC trying to enforce that deal did not go their way. In this case, the SEC is on solid ground as the law enforcing the requirements of investigative demands, or subpoenas, is clear cut, said several former SEC officials. While the stakes are lower this time, the new case again shines a spotlight on the extraordinary feud between the world's richest man and most powerful securities regulator, which has for years struggled to bring Musk to heel. ""This case is different from past forays between the SEC and Elon Musk because it's a subpoena enforcement case. These cases are really cut and dry,"" said Stephen Crimmins, a partner with Davis Wright Tremaine law firm and a former SEC trial lawyer. ""The law provides the SEC has subpoena power to take investigative testimony and gather documents."" If Musk defies the court, he is likely to be fined until he testifies, lawyers said. Further defiance could, in an extreme scenario, lead to jail. The SEC, which declined to comment, is probing whether Musk broke securities laws in 2022 when he bought stock in Twitter, which Musk renamed X, as well as statements and filings he made in relation to the deal. According to the SEC, it opened the probe in April 2022 and Musk provided documents and testified via videoconference for two half-day sessions that July. The SEC later received new documents and subpoenaed Musk in May to testify again, this time at its office in San Francisco, where X is based. Musk agreed to testify on Sept. 15, but two days beforehand raised ""spurious objections"" and said he would not appear. Musk also refused SEC proposals to testify in Texas, where he lives, in October or November, the SEC said. Among his objections, Musk said the SEC was trying to ""harass"" him and that his counsel needed time to review potentially relevant material contained in a biography of Musk published last month, the SEC said. On Thursday, Musk wrote on X that such agencies need ""a comprehensive overhaul."" Musk's attorney Alex Spiro said that the investigation was ""misguided"" and that ""enough is enough."" But it's not unusual for the SEC or other federal agencies to seek additional testimony as probes evolve, lawyers said. ""As investigations go on, you sometimes want to bring people back as you have more information,"" said Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer and former SEC attorney. He added the court will likely order Musk to sit for additional testimony. ""All you have to show is...the subpoena is part of a legitimate effort to obtain information."" The courts have previously upheld SEC's subpoena rights. In 2018, a court compelled Jay-Z to testify after he ignored SEC subpoenas, although the judge told the SEC to seek his permission if it needed more than a day. The musician was also represented by Spiro. In 2022, a judge ordered Terraform Labs' founder to comply with an SEC subpoena for documents. Just months after Musk agreed with the SEC to vet his tweets, the agency determined that he breached that deal and sued him to comply. But the judge challenged the settlement's ""soft"" standard for assessing when a tweet was material and told both parties to ""put your reasonableness pants on"" and work it out. After that, the SEC was reluctant to return to the court even though staff believed he breached the deal on subsequent occasions, Reuters reported last year. The SEC has opened other probes into Musk, who has on several occasions denigrated the agency and alleged it is harassing him. He has also disputed the SEC's finding that he did not have funding secured for the Tesla take private, and has tried unsuccessfully to have a court rescind the 2018 settlement. The San Francisco court, though, is unlikely to consider Musk's bad blood with the agency and will focus on whether the SEC has been reasonably accommodating of Musk's schedule and other logistical considerations. Lawyers Reuters interviewed said the SEC appeared to have met that bar. ""Musk is trying to make a point and he doesn’t want to be pushed around,"" said Robert Frenchman, a partner at Mukasey Frenchman who has defended clients in SEC matters. ""I don't think it's likely he wins this battle."""
Tesla workers in Germany join union as health and safety issues grow - union,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-workers-germany-join-union-health-safety-issues-grow-union-2023-10-09/,"GRUENHEIDE, Germany, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) workers at the carmaker's Brandenburg plant are joining the IG Metall union in rising numbers over concerns around health, safety and overwork, the union said on Monday. Lack of staff and inadequate safety provisions in the workplace were leading to a high number of accidents at work, and it was not rare that around 30% of workers were signed off sick, the union said in a statement. Reuters was not able to independently verify the union's claims and Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Union representatives met workers at the factory gates, on the platforms of nearby stations and inside the factory on Monday handing out stickers stating ""Together for safe and fair work at Tesla"". On Sunday night, Tesla managers invited their teams to a meeting with ""free food and a surprise"" to discuss IG Metall's presence on the site, stating: ""We want to speak with you and your teams about the questionable methods and actual goals of IG Metall,"" according to a copy of the email seen by Reuters. ""The law gives all workers the right to organise in a union and stand openly for that at their workplace. That counts at Tesla in Brandenburg as well,"" Dirk Schulze of IG Metall said. The union said it does not share specific membership numbers for companies as a matter of course, but that it has seen a steep rise in the number of new members at Tesla. Reuters spoke to twelve workers at the factory on Monday. While four said they were satisfied with working conditions, eight said pressure was too high, with some reporting high incidence of accidents and issues with receiving overtime pay. Two workers said they were not allowed to speak to the media. ""Speed is not compatible with safety,"" said one 56-year-old worker from Poland, who declined to be named, adding there were too few workers to meet targets and that he would seek a new job next year if conditions did not improve."
"UAW says its 'strike is working,' holds off on more walkouts",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-strike-decision-day-comes-bargaining-heats-up-2023-10-06/,"DETROIT, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers held off on additional strikes against Detroit Three auto plants on Friday, citing General Motors' (GM.N) unexpected willingness to allow workers at joint-venture battery plants to be covered by union contracts. GM's concession could be critical if rivals Ford Motor (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) follow suit, potentially clearing the way for final agreements that would shore up the union's position as the industry switches to making electric vehicles. ""Our strike is working, but we’re not there yet,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a livestreamed update on negotiations with the three automakers. Automakers have more than doubled initial wage hike offers, agreed to raise wages along with inflation, and improved pay for temps, but the union wants higher wages still, the abolishment of a two-tier wage system and the expansion of unions to battery shops at all three companies. Until Friday, the UAW had ratcheted up action against different automakers weekly to try to get its demands met. Threatening to strike against GM's Arlington, Texas, plant that makes cash-cow SUVs like the Cadillac Escalade spurred GM to agree that EV battery factories would become union plants with UAW contracts, Fain said. Sales of electric vehicles are growing thanks in part to federal subsidies meant to support a U.S. transition to lower carbon emissions, and the union wants those workers to obtain the same pay and job protections granted other members. ""This is absolutely a big step for all the vehicle manufacturers to get a contract done,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. ""This was the last major hurdle."" Fain did not say, however, whether workers at GM's battery plants would earn the same pay as union members at other plants. GM is building three Ultium joint-venture battery plants with South Korea's LG Energy Solution (373220.KS). In August, Ultium said it did not see any path for workers at its Ohio plant to be covered under a national labor agreement, rejecting a push by Democratic U.S. senators. GM is building a fourth U.S. battery plant with Samsung SDI (006400.KS) in Indiana. ""This defines the transition to EVs,"" said Harley Shaiken, labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ""Clearly, GM's concession on the master agreement will positively be matched by Ford and Stellantis."" The fate of battery plant workers was seen as a major sticking point, with Ford CEO Jim Farley on Sept. 29 saying that Fain was holding the deal ""hostage"" because of that aspect of the talks. Separately, Ford said on Friday it will lay off another 495 workers in Ohio and Michigan because of the strike's impact on two of its assembly plants. The companies up to now have resisted including the battery plants they are building under the master agreement, arguing most were joint-venture factories with other majority owners that have to sign off on such an agreement. ""GM has agreed to lay the foundation for a just transition,"" Fain said in his live broadcast, adding the Detroit company had ""leapfrogged"" the pack in negotiations with the UAW. GM declined to confirm Fain's news, saying only that negotiations continue. ""We will continue to work towards finding solutions to address outstanding issues,"" the company said in statement. LG Energy Solution declined to comment. A spokesperson for Samsung SDI said the company did not have a comment. Stellantis' North American chief operating officer, Mark Stewart, said in a letter to employees that the automaker is making progress in the talks, ""but there are gaps that still need to be closed."" Ford declined to comment. The pressure is only rising on the three automakers as EV market leader Tesla (TSLA.O) cut U.S. prices of its Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV, intensifying its price war and further pressuring profit on all EV models that are forced to match CEO Elon Musk's aggressiveness. Fain also said on Friday that the UAW could still strike against highly profitable pickup truck plants if progress stalls. So far, the union has avoided walking off the job at those plants. ""We know their pain points, we know their moneymakers and we know the plants they really don't want struck,"" Fain said. ""And they know we've got more cards left to play."" Fain has kept automakers in suspense as to whether he would order additional plants shut down, or give an automaker a pass because they had offered concessions. So far, the union has ordered walkouts at five assembly plants at the three companies and 38 parts depots operated by GM and Stellantis. Fain said on Friday that Ford had upped its proposed wage hike to 23% through early 2028. Combined with proposed cost-of-living-adjustments, workers could receive pay increases of close to 30%, people familiar with the proposal said. Fain's Friday video addresses have become must-see events since he launched coordinated strikes at GM, Ford and Stellantis plants shortly after midnight on Sept. 15.

Unifor says GM resisting important elements of Ford pattern agreement,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/unifor-says-gm-resisting-important-elements-ford-pattern-agreement-2023-10-06/,"Oct 6 (Reuters) - Canadian workers union Unifor on Friday said General Motors (GM.N) was ""resisting"" a number of important elements of its pattern agreement with Ford Motor (F.N). The union had chosen the company as its second bargaining target after Ford, to address GM-specific issues in another round of contract talks. Earlier last month, Unifor ratified a new three-year contract with Ford that offered wage increases of up to 25% to more than 5,600 workers at its Canadian facilities. The major issues of contention include GM’s full-time temporary workers classification, the universal health allowance for retirees and future product investment commitments, the union said. The union representing hourly workers in Canada faces an 11:59 p.m. ET deadline on Monday to reach a new deal with GM. Unifor represents about 4,300 workers at GM covered by these talks. GM Canada did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Unifor's talks with the Detroit Three automakers in Canada are separate from the United Auto Workers (UAW) union's coordinated action in the United States. In the United States, UAW held off on additional strikes against Detroit Three auto plants on Friday, citing GM's unexpected willingness to allow workers at joint-venture battery plants to be covered by union contracts. Unifor is yet to reach a deal with Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI). The Canadian operations of the Detroit Three are much smaller than their U.S. setups, but the three automakers each have critical factories in Canada."
Elon Musk's growing legal challenges,https://www.reuters.com/legal/elon-musks-growing-legal-challenges-2023-10-06/,"Oct 6 (Reuters) - Elon Musk was sued by the U.S. securities regulator related to his takeover of Twitter, the latest court battle against the billionaire whose empire spans electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA.O), space startup SpaceX and brain-chip startup Neuralink. Below is a list of Musk's legal entanglements. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has sued Musk to compel the world's richest man to testify as part of a probe into his $44 billion takeover of social media giant Twitter, a court filing on Oct. 5 showed. In May 2022, Twitter investors had sued Musk, claiming he manipulated the company's stock price by failing to disclose in March 2022 that he was amassing shares in the platform now known as X. X was sued in federal court in Florida on Oct. 2 by a legal-marketing company that claims the social media firm's new name infringes its trademark incorporating the letter ""X."" A ruling is also expected soon following a non-jury trial challenging Musk's $56 billion pay at Tesla. In the closing arguments in February, a judge pressed lawyers for Tesla directors and the investor challenging Musk's pay over whether the company's explosive growth outweighed misleading disclosures about the pay plan in 2018. Musk's major companies Tesla, SpaceX and the X social media platform are embroiled in several employment discrimination lawsuits. SpaceX was hit in October by a proposed class action lawsuit filed by a former female employee who claims the firm promotes women and minorities less often than white men. The space startup was also sued by the U.S. Justice Department in August for allegedly discriminating against asylum recipients and refugees in hiring. X faces a series of lawsuits alleging sex, age, and disability discrimination stemming from last year's layoffs of half its workforce, along with two separate cases claiming the company owes laid-off employees at least $500 million in severance pay. Tesla and Musk are defending numerous allegations of workplace harassment and discrimination, including lawsuits by California's Department of Civil Rights and by a federal civil rights agency. In April, a federal jury in San Francisco ordered Tesla to pay $3.2 million to a Black elevator operator who won a racial harassment lawsuit. Tesla has said it does not tolerate discrimination and has taken steps to address workers' complaints. Musk's tweets on the social media platform that he now owns has often courted controversy and been the subject of legal trouble. In March, a U.S. appeals court upheld a decision by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board and said Musk violated federal labor law by tweeting that Tesla employees would lose stock options if they joined a union. The court is reconsidering that ruling. In February, a U.S. jury found Musk and Tesla were not liable for misleading investors when the billionaire tweeted in 2018 that he had ""funding secured"" to take the electric car company private. The same tweet led to allegations of security fraud by the U.S. SEC and a 2018 settlement under which Musk stepped down as Tesla chairman, paid fines and agreed to get a lawyer's approval for some of his tweets before posting them. Musk now plans to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to consider whether the SEC overstepped its authority in enforcing a consent decree, as part of the 2018 settlement, that he has called a ""muzzle"" on his free speech. The settlement with SEC had lead to the creation of a ""fair fund"" under which a $41.53 million payout will be given to investors who lost money due to the Musk tweet, a federal judge said in September. Tesla is under criminal investigation in the United States over claims the company's electric vehicles can drive themselves, Reuters previously reported. Tesla is facing a lawsuit alleging its Autopilot system caused a fatal crash of a Tesla Model 3 that killed one person and injured two other passengers, according to documents filed in California state court. An attorney for Tesla, in the first U.S. trial over allegations that its Autopilot feature led to a death, however, said the crash was the result of ""a classic human error."" The company had won a bellwether trial in Los Angeles in April over a Tesla crash related to its Autopilot feature with a strategy of saying that it tells drivers that its technology requires human monitoring, despite the Autopilot name. Federal prosecutors in New York have also opened an investigation related to Musk's corporate perks and claims related to vehicle driving range, a source with knowledge of the probe said. The Wall Street Journal first reported the probe. A lawyer for former U.S. President Donald Trump on Oct. 4 asked a U.S. appeals court to revive his lawsuit claiming that X violated his and other users' free-speech rights when it suspended their accounts. The case was dismissed last year. Musk was accused in June of insider trading in a proposed class action by investors who allege he manipulated the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, costing them billions of dollars. In a filing in Manhattan federal court, investors said Musk used Twitter posts, online influencers and publicity stunts like his 2021 appearance on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" to trade profitably at their expense through several Dogecoin wallets that he or Tesla controls."

SEC tries to force Musk to testify in Twitter takeover probe,https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/elon-musks-twitter-stock-purchases-under-probe-by-sec-2023-10-05/,"Oct 5 (Reuters) - Elon Musk, the world's richest man, is being sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which is trying to compel him to testify as part of a probe into his $44 billion takeover of social media giant Twitter, a Thursday court filing showed. The investigation, which escalates a long-running feud between the SEC and Musk, concerns whether Musk broke federal securities laws in 2022 when he bought stock in Twitter, which Musk renamed X, as well as statements and SEC filings he made in relation to the deal. The SEC in May 2022 said it was looking into Musk's disclosure of his stake in Twitter, questioning whether he filed the appropriate paperwork. The SEC in Thursday's filing said it subpoenaed Musk in May 2023 requiring him to provide testimony at the SEC’s San Francisco office, and that Musk had agreed to appear on Sept. 15. But then two days beforehand Musk raised ""several spurious objections"" and told the SEC he would not appear, the SEC said. Musk also refused SEC proposals to conduct the deposition in Texas in October or November. Among his objections was that the SEC was trying to “harass” him and his counsel needed time to review potentially relevant material contained in a biography of Musk published last month, the SEC said. According to the filing, Musk has given the SEC documents relating to the probe and has previously provided testimony in July last year via video conference. ""The SEC has already taken Mr. Musk's testimony multiple times in this misguided investigation - enough is enough,"" said a statement from Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk. In a press release, the SEC said it was seeking ""Musk’s testimony to obtain information not already in the SEC’s possession that is relevant to its legitimate and lawful investigation."" An SEC spokesperson declined to comment further. Musk acquired Twitter after initially building a large minority stake in the social media platform, which he first disclosed in April 2022. Musk was late with the disclosure filing and initially indicated he planned to be a passive stakeholder, meaning he did not plan to take over Twitter or influence its management decisions. Days later, Musk accepted and then turned down a board seat at Twitter. In late April, he announced plans to buy the company for $44 billion but subsequently tried to get out of the deal, alleging Twitter was not disclosing the full extent of bot activity on its platform. Faced with a trial that sought to compel him to complete the deal, Musk closed his acquisition of Twitter in late October 2022. Thursday's filing is the latest brushup between Musk and the SEC which have been feuding since Musk's 2018 tweet that he planned to take his electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA.O) private and had funding secured. Since then, Musk has repeatedly denigrated the SEC, which has opened multiple probes into him over the years. “A comprehensive overhaul of these agencies is sorely needed, along with a commission to take punitive action against those individuals who have abused their regulatory power for personal and political gains,” Musk said in a post on X. Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses & Singer and a former SEC official, said Musk's refusal to appear at the September testimony was extraordinary. ""I have never heard of a senior executive who has positions at public companies ever not showing up."" Thursday's lawsuit adds to Musk's legal woes. Reuters previously reported the Justice Department is investigating Tesla over self-driving claims.

GM makes new counteroffer to UAW in strike talks,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-makes-counteroffer-uaw-strike-talks-2023-10-05/,"DETROIT, Oct 5 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM.N) said on Thursday it had made a counteroffer to the United Auto Workers (UAW) in a bid to end a strike by the union against the U.S. automaker. Separately, UAW President Shawn Fain plans an update on the status of the talks with the Detroit Three automakers at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Friday in the three-week-old strike. Fain posted on social media a photo that appeared to be from the reality TV show ""The Bachelorette"" featuring logos of the Detroit Three automakers superimposed over the heads three contestants. He encouraged people to watch on Friday ""to see who gets the rose!"" Fain has used prior weekly updates to announce expansions of the strike to additional plants at automakers that he said were not making significant progress toward new labor deals. The first-ever targeted strike against the Detroit Three automakers, including Ford (F.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI), began on Sept. 15. GM said the offer was its sixth since talks between the sides began. The UAW said on Monday it presented a new contract offer to GM. GM said on Monday that despite the offer, ""significant gaps remain."" ""We believe we have a compelling offer that would reward our team members and allow GM to succeed and thrive into the future,"" the company said on Thursday. A source familiar with the talks said there had been movement in a few key areas. Reuters reported on Wednesday that negotiators for the UAW and Ford have narrowed their differences on pay increases after a new offer from the automaker amid ""really active"" talks, according to people familiar with the bargaining. In addition to Ford, talks with Chrysler parent Stellantis and have been active in recent days, sources said. Stellantis declined to comment. Ford said on Tuesday it had made a ""comprehensive"" new offer that included a ""more than 20% general wage increase, not compounded"" with a double-digit increase in the first year. Ford did not elaborate. That proposal, when combined with cost-of-living adjustments previously offered by the automaker, could bring the total wage increase offer close to 30% over the life of the contract, people familiar with the situation said. However, the UAW and Ford have not announced agreements on other, significant issues including pay and union representation at future battery plants, and the union's push for a return to retirement plans that assure a defined level of benefits. In a sign the Detroit automakers are still bracing for a lengthy struggle, GM on Wednesday secured a new $6 billion line of credit and estimated the cost of the United Auto Workers strike was $200 million during the third quarter, a company spokesman said. Meanwhile, workers represented by the UAW in talks with Volvo Group (VOLVb.ST)-owned Mack Trucks will receive a 19% pay hike over five years, according to a summary of the tentative agreement seen by Reuters."
Mack Trucks workers get 19% raise over 5 years in UAW contract,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-workers-get-19-wage-hike-under-mack-trucks-contract-deal-2023-10-05/,"Oct 5 (Reuters) - Workers will receive a 19% pay hike over five years under an agreement with Volvo Group-owned Mack Trucks and the United Auto Workers, according to a summary of the tentative agreement seen by Reuters. Workers must still ratify the agreement covering 4,000 hourly workers that includes a $3,500 ratification bonus, improved retirement benefits, additional vacation for some employees and a reduction in the time needed to get to top pay. The agreement includes an immediate 10% pay hike upon ratification. The benefits include another $1,000 annual payment to 401(k) plans to offset retirement health care costs for hires since 2009 and pension benefit increases along with maintaining the current health care plans with some modest increases in copays but no hike in weekly health care contributions. ""The terms of this tentative agreement would deliver significantly increased wages and continue first-class benefits for Mack employees and their families,"" Mack President Stephen Roy said in a statement earlier this week. Mack, founded in 1900, is one of North America's largest manufacturers of medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks, engines and transmissions. Its trucks are sold in nearly 30 countries. Volvo (VOLVb.ST) bought Mack in 2000."

Tesla engineer defends 'Full Self-Driving' name at crash trial,https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-engineer-defends-full-self-driving-name-crash-trial-2023-10-05/,"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 5 (Reuters) - A Tesla (TSLA.O) engineer in court on Wednesday rejected a lawyer's suggestion that the company named its driver-assistant feature ""Full Self-Driving"" because it wanted people to believe that its systems had more abilities than was really the case. The electric-vehicle maker is defending itself at the first U.S. trial over allegations that Tesla's Autopilot feature led to a death. The lawsuit, filed in a California state court, alleges the Autopilot system caused owner Micah Lee’s Model 3 to suddenly veer off a highway east of Los Angeles at 65 miles per hour (105 kph), strike a palm tree and burst into flames, all in the span of seconds. The 2019 crash killed Lee and seriously injured his two passengers. The lawsuit accuses Tesla of knowing that Autopilot and other safety systems were defective when it sold the car. Tesla denies the claims, saying it is not even clear whether Autopilot was engaged at the moment Lee’s car crashed. The EV maker has been testing and rolling out its Autopilot and more advanced Full Self-Driving (FSD) system, which Chief Executive Elon Musk has touted as crucial to his company's future but which has drawn regulatory and legal scrutiny. The 37-year-old Lee bought Tesla's “full self-driving capability package” for $6,000 for his Model 3 in 2019. At that time, the FSD package performed functions such as maintaining distance from a vehicle in front and keeping the car within the lane, Tesla engineer Eloy Rubio Blanco testified in court on Wednesday. The automaker later added more advanced features to the system. During his testimony, Rubio rejected a suggestion from Lee's attorney that the company chose the name ""Full Self-Driving"" because it hoped the public would think its vehicles had more features. ""Do I think our drivers think that our vehicles are autonomous? No,"" Rubio said, according to a trial transcript seen by Reuters. However, Rubio also acknowledged that Tesla vehicles sold in 2019 might have “latent defects” due to the complexity of the vehicle software. He said Tesla's driver-assistant system ""has a series of limitations,"" which is why a driver should override the system when needed. For example, he said an object might be detected inaccurately, leading the car to decelerate. In certain situations, he said, the automatic braking might be insufficient to avoid a collision. Tesla asked that Rubio's testimony be kept private due to trade secrets. The judge ejected that request, though he shut down the court's live audio feed during Rubio's appearance."

UAW President Shawn Fain plans to update the union's 150,000 members at Ford, General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) on Friday, a person briefed on the union's plans said. It is not clear whether Fain will order a fresh round of walkouts, or declare sufficient progress has been made to delay strikes at additional plants. In addition to Ford, talks with Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) and other automakers and the UAW have been active in recent days, sources said. Stellantis declined to comment. Ford said on Tuesday it had made a ""comprehensive"" new offer that included a ""more than 20% general wage increase, not compounded"" with a double-digit increase in the first year.

However, the UAW and Ford have not announced agreements on other, significant issues including pay and union representation at future battery plants, and the union's push for a return to retirement plans that assure a defined level of benefits. Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said Friday the automaker's retirement offer would assure UAW workers could retire with $1 million in savings. But in a sign the Detroit automakers are still bracing for a lengthy struggle, General Motors on Wednesday secured a new $6 billion line of credit and estimated the cost of the United Auto Workers strike was $200 million during the third quarter, a company spokesman said. The targeted strike against the Detroit Three automakers began on Sept. 15 and is now in its 20th day. GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told CNBC the line of credit was ""prudent"" given statements from some UAW officials ""that they intend to drag this on for months."" He said GM has made a record contract offer and said it needs a deal that puts it ""on par with our competitors."" The union has struck two GM assembly plants and 20 parts distribution centers. The strike cost at GM reflects 16 days in which production was stopped at one assembly plant in Wentzville, Missouri, for midsized pickup trucks and vans. It also reflects the strike at GM parts facilities and knock-on impacts including a production halt at a GM car plant in Kansas due to a lack of parts. The indicated average cost of $12.5 million a day for General Motors from its filing Wednesday could rise sharply if the UAW shuts down more vehicle production in the weeks ahead. Against that backdrop, GM said in a securities filing it has locked in the new, $6 billion line of credit through October 2024. JP Morgan (JPM.N) and Citibank (C.N) are listed as joint lead arrangers for the deal. Ford secured a $4 billion line of credit in August, ahead of the Sept. 14 UAW contract expiration. GM's new line of credit will bolster its balance sheet against a protracted strike that could widen to cut off production of its most profitable vehicles: large Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks and large SUVs such as the GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade. GM shares ended down about 1% on Wednesday afternoon. The additional funds will require GM to maintain at least $4 billion in global liquidity and $2 billion in U.S. liquidity. The terms of the credit agreement also restrict GM from mergers or sales of assets and limits on other, new debt. The UAW said on Monday it presented a new contract offer to GM. GM, in turn, said despite the offer, ""significant gaps remain."" The automaker has been forced to lay off 2,100 workers at five plants in four states. Ford said Wednesday it was laying off another 400 workers in Michigan starting Thursday because of the strike after previously furloughing 930 workers, and Stellantis 370 workers in Ohio and Indiana because of the strike. Meanwhile, nearly 30% of auto parts makers surveyed by an industry trade group said they have laid off some workers due to the UAW strikes. Another 60% expect more layoffs by mid-October if the walkouts continue, the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association said."
Ex-Tesla factory worker loses bid for new trial in race bias case,https://www.reuters.com/legal/no-new-trial-ex-tesla-factory-workers-racial-harassment-case-judge-rules-2023-10-04/,"Oct 4 (Reuters) - A Black former factory worker for Tesla lost his bid on Wednesday for a third trial in his race discrimination lawsuit against the electric carmaker, after a California federal judge rejected his claims that the company's lawyers had engaged in misconduct and tainted his trial. U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco in a written order upheld a $3.2 million verdict that a jury awarded to plaintiff Owen Diaz in April, denying his motion for a new trial while also rejecting Tesla's bid to cut the award in half. The decision staves off another lengthy trial for the electric carmaker but also draws new attention to the case, one of several to allege rampant racial harassment at Tesla's flagship Fremont, California assembly plant. The most recent was filed by U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last week. In upholding the verdict, Orrick said it was justified ""in light of the endemic racism at the Tesla factory and Tesla’s repeated failure to rectify it."" Diaz, a former elevator operator, claimed he was subjected to daily racist slurs and graffiti and that Tesla ignored his complaints. His lawyers had argued that Tesla's legal team asked improper questions, baselessly accused a witness of lying and made misleading statements to the jury during a five-day trial earlier this year. Orrick said any misconduct by the company's lawyers did not so permeate the entire trial to have improperly influenced and prejudiced the jury. Diaz had been awarded $137 million by a different jury in 2021, but Orrick then ruled that verdict was excessive. The judge ordered the second trial to determine damages after Diaz turned down a lower payout of $15 million. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Lawrence Organ, a lawyer for Diaz, said he was considering an appeal and expects Tesla to file an appeal seeking to lower the award. Organ said that despite losing the bid for a new trial, the $3.2 million award was large for a race discrimination case and demonstrated the severity of the harassment alleged by Diaz. “Courts don’t typically uphold large, multimillion-dollar awards in these cases, so from that standpoint this is clearly a victory for Diaz and for civil rights,” Organ said. Orrick barred both sides from presenting new evidence or testimony at the second trial, which took place in March. Diaz claimed Tesla's lawyers violated that directive by questioning him and other witnesses about alleged altercations between Diaz and other workers, which had not come up at the first trial. Diaz denies those incidents took place. Tesla has said it does not tolerate discrimination and takes complaints from workers seriously. The company has also denied wrongdoing in several other lawsuits claiming employees at the Fremont plant and other factories and service centers have faced racial or sexual harassment. Those cases include a proposed class action by Black workers and a lawsuit by a California state agency alleging widespread race discrimination at the Fremont plant, which Tesla claims was politically motivated. Last week, Tesla was sued by the EEOC, which claims that since 2015 Black factory workers have routinely been subjected to racist slurs and graffiti and retaliated against for complaining about the harassment. The EEOC sued Tesla under the federal law barring workplace discrimination, which caps damages at $300,000 per worker. The class action and the state agency's lawsuit allege violations of California law, which has no caps. Diaz had sued Tesla under a different federal law barring race discrimination in contracts, including employment contracts, which also does not cap damages."
"From Detroit Three automakers to healthcare, US labor unions flex muscle",https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/detroit-three-automakers-healthcare-us-labor-unions-flex-muscle-2023-10-04/,"Oct 4 (Reuters) - A tight U.S. labor market, the expiry of union contracts and high living costs have led to tough negotiations for pay hikes and benefits from workers and triggered strikes and protests across industries. Nearly 309,700 workers have been involved in work stoppages and strikes through August this year, according to preliminary data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, putting 2023 on track to becoming the busiest year for strikes since 2019. Here are some sectors and companies that faced tough negotiations in 2023: Hollywood's writers union struck a tentative deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers in late September after five months of failed negotiations. Film and television writers had walked off the job in May over compensation, staffing and residual payments, among other issues. The striking writers were later joined by the SAG-AFTRA actors union, which remains on strike. Negotiators for striking Hollywood actors resumed contract talks on Monday with representatives of major studios, television networks and streaming services AUTOMOTIVE The United Auto Workers (UAW) union has expanded its ongoing strike against the Detroit Three automakers - General Motors (GM.N), Ford Motor (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI). The coordinated strike, which began after the earlier contracts expired on Sept. 15, initially targeted three assembly plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri. About 4,000 workers represented by UAW reached an agreement with Volvo Group-owned Mack Trucks late on Sunday to avoid a strike. About 98% of the truck company's workers had authorized a strike last month. Teamsters union workers at United Parcel Service (UPS.N) ratified a new five-year contract in August, a deal that raises pay, eliminates a two-tier wage system for drivers, provides another paid holiday and ends forced overtime. FedEx (FDX.N) pilots have been involved in a standoff with the parcel delivery firm over wages and legacy pensions. Pilots rejected a tentative deal in July and negotiations are expected to restart. Pilots at several airlines including American Airlines (AAL.O), Delta Airlines (DAL.N), United Airlines Holdings (UAL.O), Spirit Airlines (SAVE.N) and Jetblue Airways (JBLU.O) negotiated new job contracts this year. Members of some unions like the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association have voted to authorize a strike if a new contract is not reached. Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N) negotiated a new contract to end a strike that led to a week-long work stoppage at its plant in Wichita, Kansas. U.S. steel producer Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF.N) has reached a tentative agreement with the United Steelworkers union on a new three-year labor agreement for its Northshore mining operations. U.S. Steel (X.N), which is reviewing multiple proposals ranging from partial acquisition to an entire buyout, is embroiled in a tussle with the United Steelworkers union. The company's unionized workers say they essentially have the power to veto any transaction they do not approve of. Unions representing roughly 53,000 Las Vegas workers on Tuesday kicked off negotiations with hotel and casino operators over a new five-year contract. Members of the union had in September voted to authorize a city-wide strike. Last week, workers at three Detroit casinos - MGM Grand Detroit, Hollywood at Greektown and MotorCity - voted in favor of authorizing a strike at all three locations if a new contract agreement isn't reached. The Detroit Casino Council (DCC), which represents the workers, could call for strikes as soon as mid-October, when contracts expire. More than 3,000 workers at more than 150 Starbucks (SBUX.O) stores in the U.S. held strikes in June, following claims the company had banned Pride Month decorations at some of its cafes.  read more   read more  Thousands of Los Angeles-area hotel staffers went on a three-day strike in July over improved wages, benefits and working conditions. Union leaders representing the workers have threatened further walkouts. Tens of thousands of nurses and other healthcare workers at Kaiser Permanente launched a planned three-day strike on Wednesday, after negotiations failed to meet the union deadline for reaching a settlement regarding a new contract covering nurses, medical technicians and support staff. The work stoppage marks the largest strike ever in the U.S. medical industry. More than 7,000 nurses went on a three-day strike in New York City over staffing levels and pay hikes in January. Unions representing cannabis workers have also increased pressure on companies in the sector this year. Workers at Green Thumb Industries' (GTII.CD) Chicago-area RISE dispensaries went on a 13-day unfair labor practices (ULP) strike in April, which was the longest ULP strike at a cannabis retailer in U.S. history. Labor unions secured new contract agreements at multistate operator-owned cannabis dispensaries in Illinois and in New Jersey in July. Unionized workers at Phillips 66's (PSX.N) refinery in Roxana, Illinois, ratified a contract with the refiner in late-stage negotiations, averting a potential strike. The union had been in talks with the refiner since summer, when it rejected a company proposal and sought additional benefits for holiday and vacation hours and pay, among other improvements."
"Ford makes new offer in US labor dispute, GM furloughs more workers",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-furloughs-another-163-workers-due-uaw-strike-2023-10-03/,"Oct 3 (Reuters) - Ford Motor (F.N) said on Tuesday it had made a new comprehensive contract offer in an effort to resolve a 19-day old targeted strike by the United Auto Workers but said a dispute over battery plants remained unresolved. The Dearborn, Michigan automaker said the new offer boosted wages for temporary workers, increased company 401(k) contributions and had further shrunk time needed to get to the top wage rate. UAW President Shawn Fain on Friday expanded the first-ever simultaneous strike against the Detroit Three to a GM Lansing, Michigan, plant and a Ford Chicago assembly plant, but Stellantis was spared after last-minute concessions. Ford said Tuesday the UAW ""has taken a hard line on battery plants"" after CEO Jim Farley accused the UAW of holding the contract ""hostage"" over the fate of those plants, a charge the union rejected. The UAW says ""job security"" in the electric vehicle transition remains an open issue. The UAW declined comment Tuesday on Ford's new offer. The UAW said on Monday it presented a new contract offer to General Motors (GM.N). GM said despite the offer ""significant gaps remain."" The UAW also held a new round of bargaining with Chrysler-parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) Monday. Earlier Tuesday, GM said it furloughed 163 UAW workers at GM’s Toledo Propulsion Systems plant that makes transmissions for both the automaker's Missouri and Lansing Delta Township assembly plants that are on strike. GM said in total it has been forced to lay off 2,100 workers at five plants in four states including halting production at its Kansas car plant because of strike impacts. On Monday, GM and Ford said they laid off another 500 workers at four Midwestern plants because of the impact of the strike. Stellantis has furloughed nearly 370 workers in Ohio and Indiana. Anderson Economic Group on Monday estimated total losses from the first two weeks of the strike at $3.9 billion, including $325 million in wages, $1.12 billion in losses for the Detroit Three, $1.29 billion for suppliers and $1.2 billion for dealer and customer losses."
Tesla bashes $229 million fee bid for plaintiffs in board pay case,https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/column-tesla-bashes-229-million-fee-bid-plaintiffs-board-pay-case-2023-10-03/,"Oct 3 (Reuters) - A brewing fee dispute in Delaware Chancery Court poses a novel question: Can stock options be worth one price to the company that issued them and another to the board members who received them? Last July, when Tesla’s outside directors agreed to settle a shareholder derivative lawsuit accusing board members of granting themselves outsized compensation, the deal was billed as being worth a staggering $919.4 million — the biggest-ever recovery in a shareholder derivative suit and the second-highest settlement in the history of Chancery Court. Nearly half of that $919 million was in the form of stock options that had been awarded to Tesla board members but would be returned to the company under the terms of the settlement. Those returned options, according to the shareholder lawyers who negotiated the settlement, are worth $458 million. Another $184 million of the total value of the settlement, according to the plaintiffs firms, was in three years of unpaid compensation, from 2020 to 2022, that board members agreed to forgo entirely. In September, plaintiffs' lawyers from Bleichmar Fonti & Auld, Fields Kupka & Shukurov and McCarter & English asked Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick to award them fees of $229.6 million, or 25% of the $919 million monetary value of the settlement. The request worked out to a lodestar rate of more than $10,000 per hour, but the shareholder firms said their jumbo fee request was justified by the historic results they obtained. Tesla thinks otherwise. In a brief made public on Monday, the company argued that shareholder lawyers deserve only $63.5 million — less than one-third of their requested fee — because the settlement, according to Tesla, is actually only worth $295 million, not the $919 million plaintiffs claimed. Huh? Plaintiffs' lawyers, after all, did not ask for fees based on the amorphous value of corporate governance reforms or additional disclosures in an M&A proxy filing. Their request was based on money that would either flow back to Tesla — in the form of $276.6 million in actual Tesla shares and $458 million in stock options — or would be retained by Tesla because the director defendants had agreed to forgo three years of compensation. Nor did plaintiffs' lawyers pull their stock options valuation out of thin air: The number was calculated by an outside expert based on a widely accepted methodology that took into account Tesla’s share price on the day of the tentative deal and the cost of the options to the director defendants. Indeed, in a Sept. 22 brief supporting the settlement, Tesla’s outside directors did not dispute plaintiffs’ asserted $458 million valuation of the options, even as they took considerable umbrage at plaintiffs’ description of their conduct. (They argued that Tesla’s system of compensating directors with stock options actually aligned board members with shareholders.) But Tesla told McCormick in its newly public brief that stock options can simultaneously be worth vastly different amounts of money to the company that granted them and to the board members who received them. And regardless of the value of the options to the board members who agreed to return them to the company, Tesla said, the returned options are worth only about $19 million to the corporation itself. “The value of an option in the hands of a director defendant is not the same as the value of that option in the hands of Tesla,” wrote the company’s lawyers at Bayard. “Tesla cannot exercise the option and capture the difference between the settlement stock price and the strike price of an option. The returned options will just be canceled as part of the settlement.” Those cancellations, Tesla said, will reverse accounting charges of about $19 million that were entered when the company issued the options. And that, according to Tesla, is the entire value of the returned options as far as the corporation is concerned. The directors’ returned options, as Tesla tells the tale, will simply go back into a big pool of authorized but unissued options — and Tesla already has all of the options it needs to recruit new talent and to meet its obligations under its executive incentive plan. Tesla also disputed plaintiffs’ $184 million valuation of the compensation that its outside directors agreed to forgo as part of the settlement. That number was based on unissued stock options, but Tesla said it was pure speculation that directors would have been issued any additional options after the board voted to halt automatic grants in 2020. Shareholder firms contended that they should be credited for averting any opportunity for the board to issue retrospective awards to outside directors who went without pay for three years when the board halted stock option grants. Tesla said the plaintiffs should not receive fees based on that hypothetical. Remember, Tesla is the beneficiary of the settlement with its board members because the case is a shareholder derivative action, in which shareholders stepped into the shoes of the corporation to prosecute claims against board members. Tesla said that from its perspective, the deal is worth just$295 million — the value of the actual shares directors agreed to return to the company plus the $19 million in options grant accounting charges that will be canceled when the options are returned. Plaintiffs' lawyers, according to Tesla, are entitled to no more than 21.5% of that total, based on the stage of the litigation when the case settled and time and effort shareholders dedicated to the case. Shareholder firms had pointed in their brief requesting fees to a whopper $267 million fee awarded in August to plaintiffs' lawyers who obtained a $1 billion cash settlement with Dell board members. Tesla said in its opposition brief that the billing records underlying the Dell fee, which amounted to about 27% of the $1 billion settlement, show why the shareholder firms in its case deserve less. Javier Bleichmar of Bleichmar Fonti declined to comment on Tesla’s brief opposing shareholders’ fee request. Plaintiffs are scheduled to file their response on Friday. Neither Tesla nor its lawyers from Bayard responded to my email query on the fee dispute.

"US new auto sales likely rose in Q3, but UAW strikes may pose speed bump",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-new-auto-sales-likely-rose-q3-uaw-strikes-may-pose-speed-bump-2023-10-02/,"Oct 2 (Reuters) - U.S. new vehicle sales likely rose in the third quarter on improving supply and steady demand, but a strike by autoworkers has muddied the outlook for the ""Detroit Three"" for the rest of the year, analysts said. General Motors (GM.N) was set to remain the top-selling automaker with 680,009 vehicles sold in the quarter ended September, while second-placed Toyota (7203.T) was expected to finish the quarter at 583,661 vehicle sales, according to car shopping website Edmunds. But that may change after the United Auto Workers (UAW) union launched unprecedented, coordinated strikes against GM, Ford (F.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI) last month. ""The production disruptions caused by the strike will have ramifications for potential sales levels moving through the fourth quarter,"" S&P Global Mobility said in a note. The UAW union initially targeted one assembly plant at each of the Detroit Three automakers that make some of their most profitable models and later expanded the coordinated strike, citing a lack of progress in talks. S&P forecast daily losses from the strike at the three plants at over 4,000 units, warning further walkouts may lead to cumulative losses reaching hundreds of thousands of units. The automakers haven't disclosed a financial hit from the strikes so far and September sales are likely to be unscathed given the inventory built up in anticipation of the strike. But analysts have warned that a prolonged, full strike may cost billions of dollars. That may play into the hands of non-unionized automakers such as Tesla (TSLA.O) and foreign brands like Toyota, with the companies grabbing market share from the Detroit Three. Meanwhile, pent-up demand from retail and commercial customers could buoy third-quarter sales. U.S. new vehicle sales likely rose 17% to 3,941,700 units, whereas, the September seasonally adjusted annualized rate is expected to be 15.4 million units, consultants J.D. Power and GlobalData said. Automakers are expected to report quarterly sales in the coming days."
Pirelli's Chinese investors terminate shareholder agreement,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/pirellis-chinese-investors-terminate-shareholder-agreement-2023-10-03/,"MILAN, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Pirelli's (PIRC.MI) Chinese investors Sinochem and Silk Road Fund have decided not to extend their agreement to work together on some issues at the tyremaker, the Italian group said on Tuesday. The two investors, which hold stakes of 37% and 9% respectively, had initially signed the shareholder agreement in 2020. As part of it, Silk Road Fund had committed to follow Sinochem's votes at Pirelli shareholder meetings on selected matters for a stake comprising 5% out of their total 9%. The agreement terminated due to its expiry on Sept. 29, Pirelli said in a statement, without providing reasons for the decision. State-owned Sinochem has a separate governance agreement with fellow investor Camfin, the vehicle of Marco Tronchetti Provera, the Italian businessman who has been in charge of Pirelli since 1992 and now holds the role of executive vice chairman. Earlier this year the Italian government used so called ""golden power"" legislation that protects key national assets to impose prescriptions on the proposed renewal of the governance pact between Sinochem and Camfin. Rome's intervention strengthened the influence of Camfin over Pirelli even though it just has a 14.1% stake in the company, the tyre supplier for Formula One motor racing."
Analysis: Detroit's strikes become an industrial 'Survivor' game,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/detroits-strikes-become-an-industrial-survivor-game-2023-10-03/,"DETROIT, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers head into the 19th day of strikes with a bold strategy that places the Detroit Three automakers into a high-stakes game of ""Survivor"" with a weekly decision on which factories the strike will hit next, with layoffs mounting, suppliers hurting and harsh rhetoric from both sides. UAW President Shawn Fain has transformed the rituals of contract talks with General Motors(GM.N), Ford(F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) into a high-stakes, made-for-media game. The automakers will look for clues on how to survive in the agreement the union reached on Sunday with Volvo Group-owned (VOLVb.ST) Mack Trucks. For now, the union appears to be in control, although there is pain on both sides. GM and Ford said Monday they were indefinitely laying off another 500 workers at four Midwestern plants, citing the impact of the walkouts. Analysts looking ahead to third-quarter financial results this month are starting to reckon the costs of what the UAW calls ""Stand up strikes."" JP Morgan estimated GM has lost $191 million in operating profit, and Ford $145 million during the quarter. Those are large sums, but not in the context of GM or Ford, which have forecast combined pre-tax profits of up to $26 billion for this year. The daily cost of the strikes is almost certain to rise weekly, JP Morgan added. The real pain will start if the UAW orders walkouts at factories that build Ford, Chevrolet and Ram pickup trucks and large SUVs such GM's Cadillac Escalade. At the current pace, it could take the UAW weeks to get to those factories. ""We have the power to keep escalating and keep taking plants out,"" Fain said in a video address on Sept. 13. ""This is going to create confusion for the companies. This is going to keep them guessing on what will happen next."" Last Friday, the UAW displayed the effectiveness of its strategy of launching limited strikes at all three companies at once, rather than tackling each company one at a time as in the past. Fain was prepared to order walkouts at one assembly plant for each of the three automakers. At the last minute, he decided not to order a strike at a Stellantis factory because the parent of Chrysler offered new concessions minutes before the union president's scheduled Facebook Live address. The previous week, Ford got a pass when it made more favorable job security and inflation protection proposals. UAW workers at GM and Stellantis parts depots walked off the job, while Ford's employees kept shipping parts to dealers. The rules of the game are clear: For automakers to avoid a wider walkout and more lost revenue, they must make new steps toward satisfying union demands by Friday's deadline. ""It is negotiations that are evaluated by the UAW weekly,"" said Harley Shaiken, labor professor at the University of California Berkley. ""Now, if you don't give something that the union wants, you will have another plant on strike."" The CEOs of GM and Ford last week accused Fain of misrepreseting the state of bargaining and spending too much time on television and not enough at the bargaining table. Both stopped short of accusing the UAW of bad faith bargaining, but they both accused Fain of putting the companies and union jobs at risk. ""The UAW is pitting the companies against one another,"" GM CEO Mary Barra said in a statement Friday. ""But it’s a strategy that ultimately only helps the non-union competition."" Ford CEO Jim Farley warned that suppliers to the automaker's Michigan Assembly plant, which builds Bronco SUVs and Ranger pickups, are on a ""knife's edge"" with thousands of jobs at risk. ""What’s really frustrating is that I believe we could reach a compromise on pay and benefits, but so far the UAW is holding the deal hostage over the battery plants,"" Farley said. Ford plans four EV battery plants in the U.S. - three under joint ventures with South Korean battery maker SK On(096770.KS). The fourth would be a wholly-owned facility planned in Marshall, Michigan, to build low-cost lithium-iron batteries with technology from China's CATL.(300750.SZ) Technically, the joint venture plants are separate companies not subject to the labor talks. GM's joint venture battery plants also have separate status and GM has declined to include them in negotiations. Nonetheless, Fain has made an issue of lower wages at the battery joint ventures. The union seeks to avoid a situation where non-union, lower-paid battery plant jobs eventually replace UAW-represented combustion powertrain jobs. What happens next and when is unclear, by design. The UAW was holding new bargaining sessions with GM and Stellantis on Monday. Company bargainers were likely to seek details of the tentative deal the union struck with Mack Trucks, which if ratified will significantly increase wages for almost 4,000 UAW members at the truck maker. The sides agreed just before the Sunday night deadline, not long after Fain on Friday had blasted the truck maker of “following the same tired playbook as many of our other employers.”"
"GM, Ford furlough another 500 workers due to UAW strike",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-furloughs-another-160-workers-due-uaw-strike-2023-10-02/,"Oct 2 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM.N) and Ford Motor (F.N) on Monday said they are laying off another 500 workers at four Midwestern plants because of the impact on some of the facilities of the United Auto Workers strike in its 18th day. Separately, the UAW confirmed it presented a new contract offer to GM on Monday. GM said it received the counterproposal ""but significant gaps remain."" The UAW also held a new round of bargaining with Chrysler-parent Stellantis. Ford on Monday said it was furloughing a total of 330 workers at its Chicago Stamping and Lima, Ohio Engine plants, while GM layoffs included 130 at its Parma, Ohio Metal Center and 34 at its Marion, Indiana Metal Center. The UAW on Friday struck GM's Lansing Delta Township assembly plant that makes the Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse SUVs after previously striking at GM's Missouri assembly plant and 18 parts distribution centers. GM last month said it had idled its Fairfax, Kansas, plant because of a parts shortage stemming from the strike, resulting in 2,000 indefinite layoffs. Ford said last month it temporarily laid off about 600 workers at a Michigan auto plant because of the strike. Stellantis has furloughed nearly 370 workers in Ohio and Indiana. UAW President Shawn Fain on Friday expanded the first-ever simultaneous strike against the Detroit Three to a GM Lansing, Michigan plant and a Ford Chicago assembly plant, but Stellantis was spared after last-minute concessions. The UAW said it reached a new labor agreement with Volvo Group's (VOLVb.ST) Mack Trucks covering 4,000 workers just before a Sunday night deadline. The tentative agreement that includes significantly increased wages must still be ratified, the union said. JPMorgan in a research note on Monday estimated the strike has cost GM $191 million and Ford $145 million, but said there was some cause for optimism about a deal, citing reports that the two sides were ""close on pay and benefits."" The GM and Ford CEOs on Friday blasted the UAW, hours after the union escalated the strike. The UAW responded on social media that neither had attended bargaining talks. Anderson Economic Group estimated total losses from the first two weeks of the strike to be $3.9 billion, including $325 million in wages, $1.12 billion in losses for the Detroit Three, $1.29 billion for suppliers and $1.2 billion for dealer and customer losses."
Tesla scores Autopilot victory as judge rules owners must use arbitration,https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-owners-must-arbitrate-false-advertising-claims-over-autopilot-feature-2023-10-02/,"Oct 2 (Reuters) - In a victory for Tesla (TSLA.O), a judge has ruled that a group of vehicle owners must pursue claims that the company misled about its Autopilot features in individual arbitration rather than court. The ruling means Tesla will not have to face class action claims on behalf of much larger groups of vehicle owners. U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam in Oakland, California, in a decision issued on Saturday said four Tesla owners who filed a proposed class action last year had agreed to arbitrate any legal claims against the company when they accepted its terms and conditions while purchasing vehicles through a Tesla website. A fifth plaintiff who did not sign an arbitration agreement waited too long to sue, Gilliam ruled in dismissing that plaintiffs' claims. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. Andrew Kirtley, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, said he was prepared to file thousands of individual arbitration cases on behalf of Tesla customers. ""It is telling that Tesla doesn’t want to defend its marketing practices in public in open court but instead has fought to get as many of these claims as possible sent to private arbitration,"" Kirtley said in an email. The lawsuit accuses Tesla of repeatedly making false statements indicating that its advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) technology was on the verge of delivering fully self-driving vehicles. The plaintiffs all said that they paid thousands of dollars to purchase the optional ADAS technology when they bought Tesla cars between 2017 and 2022. But instead of delivering on its promises, Tesla's technology has been unreliable and has led to accidents, injuries and deaths, the plaintiffs claimed. Tesla has denied wrongdoing. The company moved to send the claims to arbitration, citing the plaintiffs' acceptance of the arbitration agreement. Gilliam on Saturday rejected claims by the plaintiffs that the agreements signed by four of the plaintiffs were unenforceable. The decision came in the midst of the first U.S. trial over allegations that Tesla's Autopilot feature led to a death because it was based on untested experimental technology that should not have been sold to the public. The plaintiffs in that trial in California state court allege the Autopilot system caused a Model 3 to veer off a highway near Los Angeles at 65 mph (105 kph), strike a palm tree and burst into flames, killing the owner and injuring two passengers. Tesla has said the accident was the result of driver error."
UAW workers and Mack Trucks reach deal to avoid strike,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-workers-volvo-owned-mack-reach-tentative-agreement-avoid-strike-2023-10-02/,"Oct 2 (Reuters) - About 4,000 workers represented by the United Auto Workers (UAW) reached an agreement with Volvo Group-owned Mack Trucks just before midnight Eastern Standard Time (0400 GMT) on Sunday, the union and the company said. The temporary agreement must still be ratified by the UAW. ""The terms of this tentative agreement would deliver significantly increased wages and continue first-class benefits for Mack employees and their families,"" Mack President Stephen Roy said in a statement. The union announced the deal on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. About 98% of the truck company's workers had authorized a strike last month, according to the UAW. The UAW is currently in the third week of an ongoing strike against the Detroit 3 automakers, General Motors (GM.N), Ford and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI). Should Mack workers have gone on strike, it could have strained the UAW's limited strike fund. Workers across industries ranging from airlines to shipping and from retail to entertainment have been pressing for better wages and benefits from large U.S. companies in recent months due to high inflation and low unemployment. The U.S. labor movement's efforts have broad national support, with a recent Reuters poll showing a majority of Americans agree with the auto workers' and Hollywood actors' aims for better compensation. Mack, founded in 1900, is one of North America's largest manufacturers of medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks, engines and transmissions, according to its website. Its trucks are sold in nearly 30 countries. The company had said on Thursday its bargaining teams had reached tentative agreements but certain discussions were still ongoing. ""While it is true that the parties are currently far apart on the economics, this is not unusual at this point in the negotiations, and we expect progress in the coming days,"" Mack had said then. Volvo (VOLVb.ST) bought Mack in 2000."

Nearly 309,700 workers have been involved in work stoppages and strikes through August this year, according to preliminary data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, putting 2023 on track to become the busiest year for strikes since 2019. Here are some sectors and companies that faced tough negotiations in 2023: Hollywood is experiencing its first dual work stoppage of writers and actors in 63 years, halting productions across the industry and costing the California economy billions of dollars. The strike is over compensation, staffing and residual payments among other issues. The United Auto Workers (UAW) union last week launched simultaneous strikes against Ford (F.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) over pay and benefits, initially targeting one U.S. assembly plant at each company. The union on Friday announced it would expand its strikes against GM and Stellantis and target their distribution centers, with UAW President Shawn Fain saying the expansion would turn the strike into a nationwide event. However, the union said it had made real progress in talks with Ford. Teamsters union workers at United Parcel Service (UPS.N) ratified a new five-year contract in August, a deal that raises pay, eliminates a two-tier wage system for drivers, provides another paid holiday and ends forced overtime. FedEx (FDX.N) pilots have been involved in a stand-off with the parcel delivery firm over wages and legacy pensions. Pilots rejected a tentative deal in July and negotiations are expected to restart. Pilots at several airlines including American Airlines (AAL.O), Delta Airlines (DAL.N), United Airlines Holdings (UAL.O), Spirit Airlines (SAVE.N), Jetblue Airways (JBLU.O) negotiated new job contracts this year. Members of some unions like the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association have voted to authorize a strike if a new contract is not reached. Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N) negotiated a new contract to end a strike that led to a week-long work stoppage at its plant in Wichita, Kansas. U.S. steel producer Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (CLF.N) has reached a tentative agreement with the United Steelworkers union on a new three-year labor agreement for its Northshore mining operations.

"GM, Ford chiefs clash with UAW as union expands strikes",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/strikes-could-idle-more-detroit-three-auto-plants-friday-2023-09-29/,"DETROIT, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The chief executives of GM and Ford blasted United Auto Workers leaders on Friday, and UAW chief Shawn Fain responded in kind, hours after the union escalated the strike that is now in its third week. Fain on Friday expanded the first-ever simultaneous strike against the Detroit Three, ordering workers to walk off the job at Ford's Chicago assembly plant and GM's (GM.N) Lansing, Michigan, assembly plant. He said Stellantis was spared after last-minute concessions by the Chrysler parent. ""It’s clear that there is no real intent to get to an agreement,"" GM CEO Mary Barra said late Friday, while Ford CEO Jim Farley said the union was holding a deal ""hostage"" over a dispute over future electric vehicle battery plants. The UAW responded on social media that neither CEO had attended bargaining this week. “And yet, Barra and Farley made a combined $50 million dollars last year,” the union added. The harshly worded personal statements showed increasing frustration with the pace of negotiations that are entering their third week. Farley said the UAW demands ""could have a devastating impact on our business."" He said the dispute centered around wages and benefits at new electric vehicle battery plants that have yet to start production. “I don’t know why Jim Farley is lying about the state of negotiations,"" Fain said in response. ""It could be because he failed to show up for bargaining this week, as he has for most of the past 10 weeks."" The union and the companies remain far apart on key economic issues and the CEO statements suggested they are not close to resolving many sticking points. Fain has stuck with a demand for 40% pay hikes over a four-year contract, a position supported this week by President Joe Biden. The companies have offered pay hikes of about 20%. Barra accused Fain of dragging workers into a long, unnecessary strike and trying to ""make history for himself"" with the action. ""Jeopardizing our future is something I will not do,"" Barra added. The union continued its deliberate approach to the strike, choosing to walk out of just two additional assembly plants - rather than the sweeping impact of a walkout at the Detroit Three's most profitable plants that make pickup trucks. In addition, the union is trying to conserve a limited strike fund that may be strained by additional strikes at Mack Trucks facilities and Detroit-area casinos that are also represented by the UAW. ""The strike costs the union a lot of money. It's $500 per worker per week. With the additional 7,000 (workers walking out) we are talking about over $12 million a week out of the strike fund,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. Fain said differences with Ford include retirement benefits and job guarantees. The total number on picket lines has grown to 25,000, or about 17% of the union's members at the three automakers. Rather than the hammer blow of a mass walkout it has wielded historically, the UAW is strategically playing the companies against each other, using reprieves from expansion of work stoppages as encouragement with different automakers the last two weeks. Workers on Friday walked out of the Ford assembly plant in Chicago that builds the Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs, as well as the GM plant in Lansing that makes the Chevy Traverse and Buick Enclave SUVs. Farley said the union's decision to expand walkouts at Ford threatened thousands of supplier jobs. He added many suppliers are ""on a knife's edge"" because a more than two-week strike at the Michigan factory that builds Bronco SUVs and Ranger trucks. Farley said the UAW chief was holding a deal hostage to the fate of electric vehicle battery plants, including three that Ford is building with outside companies and one it has planned to own itself in Marshall, Michigan. The UAW wants those workers represented by the union and paid the highest-tier wages. Ford is now reconsidering the size and scope of the $3.5 billion Marshall battery plant in part because of uncertainty over labor costs, Farley said. Stellantis also blamed the UAW for the failure to reach a new contract. GM said in an earlier email to employees that it still has not received a comprehensive counteroffer to its Sept. 21 proposal. ""Calling more strikes is just for the headlines, not real progress,"" the company said. Stellantis (STLAM.MI), which was spared an additional walkout, said: ""We have made progress in our discussions, but gaps remain. We are committed to continue working through these issues in an expeditious manner."" Fain said that moments before he was due to address members at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT), Stellantis made significant changes in its proposal. That led to a half-hour delay in his announcement, and spared Stellantis from escalation. Fain cited progress with Stellantis around cost of living allowance payments, as well as right to strike over product commitments and plant closures. Talks continue at all three companies. Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University, said: ""What Shawn Fain wanted is a tit for tat: If you're good for us at the table, we won't mess with you. If you're bad with us at the table, we will escalate the strike."" The UAW has ratcheted up pressure over the past two weeks. Workers went on strike on Sept. 15 at one plant each from GM, Ford and Stellantis. The union escalated on Sept. 22, when workers walked off the job at GM and Stellantis distribution facilities in 20 states nationwide. UAW workers also are threatening to walk off the job at heavy truck maker Mack Trucks on Sunday, and at three Detroit casinos. A UAW strike has shut down a plant that builds axles for Mercedes-Benz's Alabama vehicle factory."
Ford CEO says UAW holding labor deal 'hostage' over fate of battery plants,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-ceo-says-uaw-holding-labor-deal-hostage-over-fate-battery-plants-2023-09-29/,"WASHINGTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Ford Motor (F.N) Chief Executive Jim Farley on Friday accused the United Auto Workers union of holding up a new U.S. labor agreement in a bid to force the automaker to pay workers at new battery plants the same top wages as workers at assembly plants. Farley also disclosed the automaker is awaiting ""final language"" from the U.S. Treasury on whether batteries made at a planned Michigan plant using Chinese technology will qualify for tax credits. ""The UAW is holding the deal hostage over battery plants,"" Farley said, and claimed a ""bad deal"" could threaten financial viability of some U.S. vehicle production. . UAW President Shawn Fain said Farley was not telling the truth about the negotiations and said the sides were far apart on core economic proposals including ""job security in this EV transition, which Farley himself says is going to cut 40% of our members’ jobs."" On Monday, Ford said it had paused work on its $3.5 billion Marshall, Michigan battery plant that will use technology licensed from Chinese battery company CATL (300750.SZ), citing concerns about its ability to operate competitively. In 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) barring $7,500 in future consumer EV tax credits if any battery components are manufactured or assembled by a ""foreign entity of concern."" Ford is awaiting guidance to determine if batteries produced by the Marshall plant would meet the requirements. ""We can make Marshall a lot bigger or a lot smaller,"" Farley said. On Sept. 8, Ford wrote Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm warning that an unfavorable interpretation of the foreign entity provision would lead the automaker to make ""fewer batteries in Michigan, shrinking that project and affecting the volume at EV assembly plants outside of Michigan. This will mean fewer U.S. jobs."" This week, the chairs of three U.S. House committees demanded Ford turn over documents tied to the CATL partnership. Republican lawmakers have been probing Ford's battery plant plan for months over concerns it could send U.S. tax subsidies to China and leave Ford dependent on Chinese technology."

The union had filed the charges on Aug. 31 with the National Labor Relations Board charging the automakers had refused to bargain in good faith, which both companies strongly denied. The UAW on Sept. 15 launched the first-ever simultaneous strike against the Detroit Three automakers and now has targeted 43 facilities covering about 25,000 out of about 150,000 hourly auto workers. The companies and UAW have exchanged numerous contract offers over the last month."
Sigma Lithium questions reporting on Brazil mineral rights 'injunction',https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/sigma-lithium-questions-reporting-brazil-mineral-rights-injunction-2023-09-29/,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Sigma Lithium (SGML.V) on Friday challenged a Reuters report that a Brazilian court had imposed an ""injunction"" on its ability to sell or mine two plots where it planned open pits, and reiterated that it saw no hurdle to its expansion plans. In a press release, Sigma said ""recent media reports"" had ""incorrectly denominated as an 'injunction'"" a Brazilian judge's ruling in a lawsuit between the company's former co-CEOs. Sigma's spokesperson and lawyers have repeatedly referred to the ruling as an ""injunction"" in recent weeks. Reuters reported on Thursday that a Sao Paulo state judge issued an injunction in late June over a May transfer in which Sigma received, at no cost, the mineral rights to the plots from a subsidiary of a company called RI-X Mineracao e Consultoria. The injunction, Reuters reported, was imposed after Sigma's former co-CEO, Calvyn Gardner, accused its current CEO, his wife Ana Cabral-Gardner, of misusing her powers as a majority shareholder in RI-X to push through the transfer. At the time of the transfer, Gardner owned 49% of RI-X and Cabral-Gardner held 51%. The two are currently getting divorced. Gardner's lawyers argued the transfer would grant Sigma mineral rights to valuable lithium deposits and hurt RI-X's ability to develop its own mining project. While the judge did not reverse the transfer, the injunction froze Sigma's ability to sell, mine or use the two plots as collateral, Reuters reported, citing the court documents. In its report, Reuters cited Sigma's view that the ruling would not affect its plans, as it said it can develop the area via a ""waste sharing agreement"" it signed with RI-X in August. ""The injunction has no impact on our operations,"" a company spokesperson said on Tuesday in an initial statement to Reuters. In subsequent comments later on Tuesday and on Wednesday, Sigma again referred to the judge's ruling as an ""injunction."" Sigma's lawyers also described the decision as an injunction in the Portuguese-language court documents viewed by Reuters. ""The maintenance of the injunction ... affects the free development of Sigma Mineracao's business,"" they wrote in a Aug. 28 petition asking the judge to reverse his decision. Asked on Friday why it had changed its characterization of the court decision, a Sigma press representative said the question would be referred to the company's legal counsel. Sigma shares, which on Thursday erased 4% gains to close more than 2% lower after the Reuters report, were up about 1% in midday Friday trading. In Friday's public statement, Sigma reiterated its previous position that the injunction would not hurt its expansion, as it said it can develop the area via a ""waste sharing agreement"" it signed with RI-X in August. RI-X, which is controlled by Sigma CEO Cabral-Gardner, said in a Friday statement that the transfer of rights would not impact its future operations and it did not appeal the judge's decision in the lawsuit."
Detroit Three facilities where UAW is on strike,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/detroit-three-facilities-where-uaw-is-strike-2023-09-29/,
"Explainer: UAW expands strike against GM, Ford in Week 3, spares Stellantis",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-expands-strike-against-gm-ford-week-3-spares-stellantis-2023-09-29/,"Sept 29 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union on Friday expanded its coordinated U.S. strike, this time targeting a plant at General Motors (GM.N) and Ford Motor (F.N) but refraining from an additional walkout from Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI). The ongoing strike is the first-ever simultaneous labor action against the Detroit Three automakers and is now entering its third week after the earlier contracts expired on Sept. 15. The automakers, like their global counterparts, have been focused on cost reductions, which in some cases include job cuts, to help accelerate a shift to electric vehicles (EVs) from gasoline-powered vehicles. The UAW, which represents 46,000 GM workers, 57,000 Ford employees and 43,000 Stellantis workers, kicked off negotiations with the companies in July. The union historically has picked one of the Detroit Three to negotiate with first as the so-called target that sets the pattern on which subsequent deals are based. This time, union President Shawn Fain targeted all three companies simultaneously. Contract talks between the UAW and the Detroit automakers in past years had gone on until the strike deadline and beyond. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found significant support by Americans for the striking auto workers. The strike has now spread to 25,000 workers, or about one-sixth of the workers employed by the big three. It initially targeted three assembly plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri targeted that build the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, along with other popular models. The second round of strikes expanded to 38 locations across 20 states in all nine regions of the UAW, focusing on parts distribution centers. The three automakers currently have proposed 20% raises over four-and-a-half years that the union has so far rejected. It has demanded a 40% wage hike, including a 20% immediate increase, and improvements in benefits. Fain has said Stellantis has made progress around cost-of-living allowance payments to offset inflation, as well as the right to strike over product commitments and plant closures. Talks between Ford and UAW negotiators stalled during the week after the two appeared to be close to an agreement, sources familiar with the development said. A full strike would hit earnings at each affected automaker by about $400 million to $500 million per week assuming all production was lost, Deutsche Bank previously estimated. Some losses could be recouped by boosting production schedules later, but that possibility fades if a strike extends to weeks or months. In fiscal 2019, GM's fourth-quarter profit took a $3.6 billion hit from a 40-day UAW strike. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimated on Sept. 21 that a full month of lost production would cost the three automakers $7 billion to $8 billion in lost profits. The UAW is pushing automakers to eliminate the two-tier wage system under which new hires can earn far less than veterans. Fain has said repeatedly that the union will push to restore pay improvements tied to the cost of living and retiree benefits cut during the 2008-2009 economic crisis. The UAW wants strong salary increases, given the financial success of the automakers, citing generous executive payouts and large U.S. federal subsidies for EV sales. The union also wants defined benefit pensions for all workers restored, 32-hour work weeks, job security guarantees and an end to the use of temporary workers. Fain also is aiming to get agreements that would allow the UAW to represent hourly workers at joint-venture EV battery plants opened or planned by the Detroit Three. The Detroit Three want to close the cost gap they have with foreign automakers with non-unionized U.S. factories. Ford sources estimate that their U.S. labor costs are $64 an hour, compared with an estimated $55 for foreign automakers and $45 to $50 for EV leader Tesla (TSLA.O). The companies also want greater flexibility in how they use their U.S. workforce to increase efficiency and cut costs as the industry shifts to EVs."
"UAW set to expand strike at Ford, GM",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/view-uaw-set-expand-strike-ford-gm-2023-09-29/,"Sept 29 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers will walk off the job at an additional plant each at General Motors (GM.N) and Ford (F.N), but will spare Stellantis after last-minutes concessions by the Chrysler parent, union president Shawn Fain said on Friday. ARTHUR WHEATON, DIRECTOR OF LABOR STUDIES AT CORNELL'S SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS ""The world is watching pretty closely and so far, it's still overwhelmingly on the side of the UAW.""

So I think it's having its desired effect."" ""It shouldn't affect volumes too much. It's another warning to the OEMs, they haven't hit the meat of the profits ... these are popular vehicles, but not really digging into the finances of these companies."" ""The strike costs the union a lot of money. It's $500 per worker per week. With the additional 7,000 we are talking about over $12 million a week out of the strike fund."" ""If they were to take into the bigger vehicles, the fallout would be huge as they would spread across powertrain plants, stamping plants, everything else that would come down if they were to tackle the pick up traps or full-size sport utilities."" ""This UAW debacle strike trajectory is like watching a slow moving car crash take place on black ice in our view."" ""The UAW strike is now getting nastier with both sides digging in the trenches in what could be a long and drawn out battle between the UAW and the Detroit auto stalwarts."" ""This is a defining period for Detroit and the future of the auto industry as we firmly believe that if GM, Ford, Stellantis accept anything close to the deal on the table the future will be very bleak for the U.S. auto industry."" ""If the Detroit Three took this current deal we estimate the average EV vehicle will go up in price by $3k-$5k to pass these costs onto the consumer and would ultimately be a torpedo to the future business models of the 313 area code."""

Mexican auto lobby urges authorities to fix border 'crisis' as trade hit,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/mexican-auto-lobby-urges-authorities-fix-border-crisis-trade-hit-2023-09-29/,"MEXICO CITY, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Mexico's main auto industry association on Friday urged Mexican authorities to step up efforts to work with the United States to deal with a ""migration crisis"" on the countries' shared border because of problems it is causing for trade. Added security checks by Texan authorities in response to a recent surge in border crossings have led to delays in goods transport in recent weeks, fueling concern inside the Mexican car industry, which is heavily integrated with the U.S. In a statement, the Mexican Automotive Industry Association (AMIA) urged the ""federal and local governments to redouble efforts"" with U.S. authorities aimed at reaching agreements that allow ""these very delicate issues"" to be resolved. Describing the matter as a ""migration and commercial crisis"", AMIA said the border impasses had caused considerable hold-ups and business losses, and were adversely affecting the economy of both Mexico and the United States. Mexico has seen a significant increase in the influx of migrants, many looking to reach the United States, as record numbers make the dangerous journey north through the Darien Gap at the foot of Central America. AMIA urged Mexican and U.S. authorities to take humanitarian steps to fix the problem and guarantee the free flow of trade."
Tesla sued by US agency over alleged harassment of Black factory workers,https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-sued-by-us-agency-over-alleged-harassment-black-factory-workers-2023-09-28/,"Sept 28 (Reuters) - A U.S. civil rights agency sued Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) on Thursday, claiming the electric carmaker has tolerated severe harassment of Black employees at its flagship Fremont, California, assembly plant, in charges similar to cases brought by the state and by Tesla employees. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) said in the lawsuit filed in federal court in California that from 2015 to the present, Black workers at the Tesla plant have routinely been subjected to racist slurs and graffiti, including swastikas and nooses. Tesla has failed to investigate complaints of racist conduct and has fired or otherwise retaliated against workers who reported harassment, the EEOC said in the lawsuit. The lawsuit adds federal charges to discrimination claims by the state of California and lawsuits by Tesla employees. It follows the breakdown of settlement talks with the EEOC after Tesla announced that the agency had formally raised its concerns last year. The EEOC routinely settles lawsuits with employers, and it is relatively rare for the agency’s cases to go to trial. Tesla faces several other race discrimination lawsuits that make similar claims, including a class action by workers at the Fremont plant and a lawsuit by a California civil rights agency. The company in those cases has said it does not tolerate discrimination and takes workers complaints seriously. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's stock price rose 2.4% on Thursday to $246.38. ""If the federal government gets involved, it certainly adds credibility to the claims,"" said Stephen Diamond, a law professor at Santa Clara University, who noted that he has advised investors on social responsibility at Tesla. ""Major institutional investors like pension funds will be very concerned about this type of behavior,"" he said. The EEOC in the lawsuit said it began investigating Tesla after the five-member commission's chair, Charlotte Burrows, filed an internal complaint known as a charge against the company. After finding last year that there was ""reasonable cause"" to believe Tesla had violated the federal law banning workplace race discrimination, the agency tried and failed to enter into a settlement agreement with the company, according to the lawsuit. Burrows in a statement said that combating widespread workplace harassment is a key priority for the EEOC. ""Every employee deserves to have their civil rights respected, and no worker should endure the kind of shameful racial bigotry our investigation revealed,” she said. The EEOC’s lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages for an unspecified number of Black workers, along with an order requiring Tesla to overhaul its policies prohibiting discrimination and retaliation. Tesla is seeking to fend off similar claims from the California Civil Rights Department, a state-level counterpart of the EEOC. The department alleges that Tesla discriminated against Black workers when making decisions about pay, promotions and work assignments. The department's lawsuit alleges violations of California law, while the EEOC case involves similar federal laws. Tesla has claimed that the California department's lawsuit was politically motivated and has argued that the agency violated state law by suing without first notifying the company of all of the claims or giving it a chance to settle. A California judge last year rejected Tesla's motion to dismiss that case, and is now considering various issues related to pre-trial discovery. In addition, a Black former elevator operator at the Fremont plant, Owen Diaz, is seeking a third trial in his 2017 lawsuit claiming he was subjected to severe racial harassment after a jury in April awarded him $3.2 million. A different jury in 2021 had awarded Diaz $137 million, but a federal judge said that was excessive and Diaz opted for a new trial instead of a reduced award of $15 million. Tesla is also facing a class action lawsuit in California state court over the alleged mistreatment of Black factory workers. About 240 workers have moved to join that lawsuit."
Canadian union Unifor sets Oct 9 deadline for GM negotiations,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/canadian-union-unifor-sets-oct-9-deadline-gm-negotiations-2023-09-28/,"Sept 28 (Reuters) - Canadian labor union Unifor said on Thursday it has informed General Motors (GM.N) that Oct. 9 has been set as the deadline for negotiating a deal with the U.S. automaker. ""Negotiations between Unifor and General Motors are underway to secure a tentative agreement that follows the pattern set with Ford of Canada,"" Unifor said in a statement, adding that the negotiation deadline has been set for Monday, Oct. 9 at 11:59 p.m. GM Canada and Unifor resumed negotiations on Sept. 26 for workers at Oshawa Operations, St. Catharines Propulsion Plant and Woodstock Parts Distribution Centre, according to a statement from the company. Unifor had announced GM as its second bargaining target in contract talks with the Detroit Three on Monday, a day after ratifying a new three-year contract with Ford Motor (F.N). The Canadian operations of the Detroit Three are much smaller than their U.S. setups, but the three automakers each has critical factories in Canada. Meanwhile, in the U.S., negotiators for the United Auto Workers (UAW) union could strike additional Detroit Three automotive facilities on Friday if there is no substantial progress in labor negotiations. The UAW had launched its walkouts on Sept. 15, its first simultaneous strikes at General Motors, Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) and Ford. The UAW has historically chosen one U.S. automaker to focus on reaching a contract deal that has typically set a pattern for the other automakers, but this year, it has been negotiating with all three simultaneously."
UAW makes new counter proposal to Chrysler parent Stellantis,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-makes-new-counter-proposal-chrysler-parent-stellantis-union-2023-09-28/,"Sept 28 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers made a new counter-proposal to Chrysler-parent Stellantis on Thursday, just one day before the union is set to strike additional Detroit Three automotive facilities without serious progress in ongoing labor negotiations. A union official confirmed the new proposal as talks remain active with Stellantis, General Motors (GM.N) and Ford Motor (F.N) in the strike's fourteenth day. The UAW and the Detroit Three have been far apart on key issues. As of Thursday, the UAW's position is that workers should get 40% pay increases, cost of living adjustments pegged to inflation, job or pay guarantees, an end to lower wages for lower seniority workers and defined benefit pensions. One big issue in the talks remains the compensation of workers making batteries for electric vehicles. Ford said this week it was putting a $3.5 billion Michigan battery plant on hold because of concerns it could not operate it competitively, which drew condemnation from the UAW. The automakers are offering 20% wage increases, but have proposed less generous cost of living and retirement benefits. The automakers also have not agreed to the UAW demand that new hires get top pay after 90 days on the job. The UAW did not comment on a Bloomberg report Thursday that union negotiators are aiming for a 30% wage increase, including cost of living adjustments. GM shares rose 2.5% while Ford closed up 1.4%. UAW President Shawn Fain plans to disclose the union's next steps Friday at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT) in an online address. The flurry of activity on Thursday comes after a week in which there appeared to be little movement in the contract talks. Fain hosted U.S. President Joe Biden's historic visit to a union picket line on Tuesday. Fain met Wednesday with GM negotiators. Stellantis and GM did not immediately comment. Stellantis earlier on Thursday criticized the UAW's rhetoric. ""The deliberate use of inflammatory and violent rhetoric is dangerous and needs to stop. The companies are not 'the enemy' and we are not at 'war,'"" Stellantis said, adding it has ""put a record offer on the table and are working hard to reach an agreement as quickly as possible."" Last week, the UAW expanded strikes that initially began with three assembly plants - one at each Detroit automaker - to 38 GM and Stellantis parts distribution centers but did not add any Ford facilities citing progress. Stellantis last week indefinitely laid off more than 350 workers in Ohio and Indiana because of the strike impact. Ford has furloughed 600 workers at a Michigan plant, and GM has furloughed 2,000 workers and halted production at a Kansas plant because of strike-related impacts."
Detroit casino workers to vote on authorizing strikes this Friday,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/detroit-casino-workers-vote-authorizing-strikes-this-friday-2023-09-28/,"Sept 28 (Reuters) - Workers who staff the majority of operations at the three casinos in Detroit will vote on Friday to authorize potential strikes, the United Auto Workers (UAW) union said. The union, in a release on Thursday, said workers staffing operations such as slots and table games, as well as restaurants at MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino and Hollywood at Greektown, will cast ballots on whether to authorize strikes as they negotiate for a new contract. The announcement comes as labor unions are taking advantage of low unemployment to push for higher pay and better working conditions in their talks for new labor agreements. About 18,300 UAW members working at the Detroit Three automakers are already on strike, which has led to the shutdown of one assembly plant at each of the three carmakers and 38 parts distribution centers at General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI). Should casino workers authorize a strike in Friday's vote, the Detroit Casino Council, the negotiating committee for workers, could call for strikes as soon as mid-October when contracts expire, according to the union."
UAW could expand strikes at Detroit Three on Friday,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-plans-strike-additional-auto-targets-absent-serious-progress-friday-source-2023-09-27/,"DETROIT, Sept 27 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union could strike additional Detroit Three automotive facilities on Friday if there is no serious progress in labor negotiations, a source familiar with the talks said. The union did not elaborate ahead of a planned video address by UAW President Shawn Fain at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT) on Friday. Bargaining continues at Ford (F.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI). If Fain triggers walkouts at more plants starting at noon (1600 GMT) on Friday, the UAW is expected to continue work stoppages currently underway until a new contract is ratified, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The union has already shut down one assembly plant at each of the Detroit Three, and 38 parts distribution centers at GM and Stellantis. About 18,300 UAW members are on strike, but that is only about 12% of the total number of union members working at the three automakers. Strikers are getting $500 a week from the UAW's strike fund. The UAW launched its walkouts on Sept. 15, its first simultaneous strikes at General Motors, Chrysler parent Stellantis and Ford. The union on Sept. 22 expanded its strikes against GM and Stellantis, but kept its Ford walkout limited to a single plant. It is unclear whether Ford will be targeted in the next round of actions. So far, the union and the companies remain far apart on key economic issues. Fain has stuck with a demand for 40% pay hikes over a four-year contract, a position supported by President Joe Biden during a visit to Detroit on Tuesday. The companies have countered with offers of about 20%. The UAW also is pushing automakers to eliminate the two-tier wage system, under which new hires can earn far less than veterans. The union has said negotiators at Ford are making the most progress toward an agreement. But Ford has said wide differences remain over key issues. The UAW and GM plan talks on Wednesday afternoon, two sources familiar with the discussions said. GM, Ford and Stellantis were not immediately available for comment. The UAW's list of potential next strike targets includes engine and transmission facilities, as well as factories producing large pickup trucks and SUVs. A wider strike that shuts down production of large trucks and SUVs could cost the automakers billions of dollars in revenue and profit. Analysts estimate GM, Ford and Stellantis earn as much as $15,000 per vehicle on each of their respective large pickup truck models. The UAW, which represents 46,000 workers at GM, 57,000 at Ford and 43,000 at Stellantis, began negotiations with the companies in July. Along with Biden, other politicians from both the Democratic and Republican parties have expressed support for the UAW's drive for higher pay. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner for the 2024 nomination, will speak in Michigan on Wednesday evening at a non-union auto manufacturer, as he skips the second Republican U.S. presidential debate. The UAW is not involved with that visit, and Fain has been critical of Trump in recent days. The visits by Biden and Trump highlight the importance of union support in the 2024 presidential election, even though union members represent a tiny fraction of U.S. workers."
"US new vehicle sales to rise for sixth month; UAW strike clouds October outlook, report says",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-new-vehicle-sales-rise-sixth-month-uaw-strike-clouds-oct-outlook-report-2023-09-28/,"Sept 28 (Reuters) - New vehicle sales in the United States are projected to rise for a sixth consecutive month in September on strong demand, according to an industry report, though the strike by United Auto Workers' (UAW) union has clouded the outlook going forward. U.S. new vehicle sales, including retail and non-retail transactions, are estimated to reach 1,309,900 units in September, a 13.8% jump from a year earlier, a joint report by J.D. Power and GlobalData showed on Thursday. The impact of the UAW strike has had negligible effect on September sales, according to the report. ""However, depending on the duration and scope of the (work)stoppage, there could be disruption to sales results in October and beyond,"" Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power, said in a statement. The ongoing labor strike, which began on Sept 15, between the UAW and automakers Ford (F.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI), at some U.S. facilities of these companies, has threatened the supply of newer models. Retail inventories could see a 36.5% jump in September from a year earlier, but would be still well below the pre-pandemic levels. Dealer profits, squeezed by elevated interest rates, declined due to increased vehicle supply, with fewer vehicles being sold for higher than their sticker price. Global sales for 2023 are expected to reach 87.9 million units compared with the previous estimate of 86.8 million units. ""The wildcards to the finish of 2023 are the U.S. market—which may be influenced by the ongoing UAW strike—and China, with a price war that is attracting more consumers into the new-vehicle market but is negatively affecting OEM margins,"" said Jeff Schuster of GlobalData."

""Opening a mine, done well, creates sustainable wealth and jobs...But of course this must be done with least possible impact to the environment,"" BHP CEO Mike Henry said, speaking at the IEA critical minerals & clean energy summit in Paris. ""We also have too many standards for the same ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) dimensions, leading to confusion and dissipated effort,"" he added. The mining industry is a key focus for policymakers and investors because it provides the critical raw materials needed for electric vehicles and renewable energy infrastructure, but is also responsible for up to 7% of greenhouse-gas (GHG) global emissions. As in most industries, mining companies have set targets to decarbonise, aiming to reach net zero by 2040 and 2050, but they say it is difficult to account for the whole supply chain, as metals are used across many different industries that serve customers across various geographies. This is partly blamed on a lack consistent data to measure emissions. ""Governments must provide predictability and stability to attract capital at lowest possible cost and as quickly as possible,"" Henry said. ""This means stable fiscal settings, streamlined planning and permitting processes and harmonised standards,"" he added."
Trump says UAW talks don't matter because EV shift will kill jobs,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-skips-debate-woo-blue-collar-workers-michigan-2023-09-27/,"Sept 27 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday it mattered little whether striking union autoworkers secured a favorable deal in talks with America's biggest carmakers because the shift to electric vehicles would soon make them obsolete. Speaking in terms that contrast with the confidence shown by carmarkers spending aggressively to electrify their fleets, Trump predicted the U.S. auto industry would succumb to massive losses in just a few years. ""It doesn’t make a damn bit of difference what you get because in two years you're all going to be out of business,"" Trump told several hundred blue-collar workers gathered at a non-union auto supplier outside Detroit. Trump, who chose to skip the second Republican presidential debate on Wednesday night, has made attacking President Joe Biden's promotion of electric vehicle production through incentives a routine component of his stump speech. At the debate, Trump was attacked by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as ""missing in action"", while former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie mocked him as ""Donald Duck"" for skipping the event. On Tuesday, Biden joined a picket line to show solidarity with the United Auto Workers union, which began its walkouts on Sept. 15, its first simultaneous strikes at General Motors, Chrysler parent Stellantis and Ford. Biden backed their call for a 40% pay raise and improved working conditions. In response to Trump's speech, the Biden campaign called the former president a ""billionaire charlatan"" who didn't care about the working class but instead pursued pro-business policies that moved jobs overseas during his time in office. ""Donald Trump is lying about President Biden's agenda to distract from his failed track record of trickle-down tax cuts, closed factories, and jobs outsourced to China,"" Biden's campaign said in a statement while Trump spoke. The decision by both Trump and Biden to insert themselves into the historic auto strike highlights the importance both men place on securing support from working-class voters in Michigan and other battleground states in next year's presidential race. Trump, who appears on track to clinch the Republican Party nomination and challenge Biden for the presidency, lost Michigan in 2020 by some 154,000 votes. It is one of three Rust Belt states, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, that Trump picked up in 2016 but lost in 2020, and the three will likely prove critical to both parties next year. Jason Roe, a Republican strategist based in Michigan, said Trump was successfully tapping into angst among working class voters who feel they are falling behind economically, a trend exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation. ""That’s what he's exploiting. That’s what he exploited in 2016,"" Roe said. U.S. automakers have complained that the Biden administration's rules promoting electric vehicles risk burdening them with excessive costs, but there is no evidence to suggest they are headed towards bankruptcy as Trump suggested. Spurred on by incentives, automakers are sinking tens of billions of dollars into new domestic factories to meet demand for electrified vehicle sales, which captured 8.9% of the U.S. market during the first half of 2023 and continue to grow. During Trump's 2017-2021 White House term, his administration generally sided with businesses over the interests of workers on policy matters, though some of his trade policies were aimed in part at protecting domestic manufacturing jobs. The UAW has to date not backed either presidential candidate, making it the only major union not to endorse Biden. The UAW leadership has welcomed Biden's support, however, and spoken about Trump and his record in scathing terms. Promising to end the government's EV push if elected, Trump urged the UAW to back him in the presidential race. ""I don't care what you get in the next two weeks or three weeks or five weeks,"" he said. ""They're going to be closing up and they're going to be building those cars in China and other places. It's a hit job in Michigan and on Detroit."""

Volkswagen, Europe's top carmaker, said the whole group, which includes the Porsche AG (P911_p.DE) and Audi brands, was affected. A spokesperson for Audi confirmed that production at the division had been affected as well, adding the extent of the impact was being analysed. Porsche AG had no immediate comment. The carmaker is already grappling with lower production at its all-electric Zwickau plant, where muted demand for battery-powered vehicles may change a long-standing three-shift system. Volkswagen said there had been an unspecified ""IT malfunction of network components"" at its site in Wolfsburg, Germany, its global headquarters. The outage also affected German sites in Emden, Osnabrueck, Hanover, Dresden and Zwickau, and component factories in Braunschweig, Kassel, Chemnitz and Salzgitter, the company said. ""The fault has been present since 12:30 p.m. (CET) and is currently being analysed. There are implications for vehicle-producing plants,"" the group said. ""According to current analyses, an external attack is unlikely to be the cause of the system malfunction,"" Volkswagen said, adding that efforts to fix the problem were of the highest priority and well under way."

Biden's appearance, the first visit by a U.S. president to striking workers in modern history, comes a day before Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner for president, will speak to auto workers in Michigan. The rare back-to-back events highlight the importance of union support in the 2024 presidential election, even though unions represent a tiny fraction of U.S. workers. Democrat Biden traveled to a Belleville, Michigan, parts distribution center owned by General Motors (GM.N), and joined dozens of picketers outside. ""Companies were in trouble, now they're doing incredibly well. And guess what? You should be doing incredibly well, too,"" Biden said through a bullhorn. ""Stick with it."" He was referring to a 2009 government bailout of U.S. automakers that included wage cuts. ""You deserve what you've earned. And you've earned a helluva lot more than what you're getting paid now,"" he said. Asked if he supported the 40% increase the union had asked for, a figure that mirrors CEO pay increases over four years, Biden said, ""Yes. I think they should be able to bargain for that."" Auto company sources said Biden's support for a 40% pay hike may make it harder to reach a compromise with the UAW. Talks are not advancing this week as attention is focused on Biden and Trump, they said. Tesla (TSLA.O) chief Elon Musk weighed in on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, and said the 40% ask and shorter work hours are a ""sure way"" to drive the companies ""bankrupt.""

Republicans believe Biden's push to electrify America's vehicle fleet, by pumping billions of dollars of tax rebates into EV manufacturing, is unpopular with auto workers. In a statement on Tuesday, Trump accused Biden of ""stabbing"" autoworkers in the back. Biden's EV mandate, he said, will ""annihilate"" the U.S. auto industry and cost ""thousands of autoworkers their jobs."" UAW President Shawn Fain greeted Biden at the airport, discussed the union's concerns about the shift to EVs, and handed the president a black UAW baseball cap. Calling Biden's visit a ""historic moment in time,"" Fain accused CEOs of taking the profits and leaving workers to ""fight for scraps."" ""Thank you Mr. President for coming to stand up with us,"" Fain said. ""We know the president will do right by the working class."" His comments fell short of an official endorsement for Biden's re-election bid, but Biden said on Tuesday he was not worried about the endorsement. The union is not involved with Trump's visit and Fain does not plan to attend that event, a source added. Both candidates are expected to sharpen their 2024 campaign message in Michigan. ""We are a long way from the general election, but it sure feels like the general election,"" said Dave Urban, a Republican strategist who previously worked for Trump. UAW workers this month began targeted strikes against GM, Ford (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) seeking wage rises to match CEO pay jumps, shorter work weeks and job security as the industry moves toward electric vehicles. Both the Detroit Three and the UAW have a lot at stake in federal policy decisions. Automakers are counting on Washington for billions in subsidies for EV production and negotiating with the Biden administration over future emissions rules that require a shift to EVs that the industry believes would be too fast and too expensive. The union, meanwhile, is concerned that the transition to EVs will mean a loss of jobs as those vehicles require fewer parts in production. Only 10.1% of U.S. workers were union members in 2022, but they have outsized political influence because the states where they are strong often swing from voting Democratic to Republican, and their grassroots networks are powerful influences on the working-class vote. The auto industry and its labor movement are deeply intertwined with politics and elections in Michigan and other midwestern U.S. states. In 2016, Trump earned a level of support from union members that no Republican had reached since Ronald Reagan, helping him narrowly capture critical states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Biden rebounded with unions in 2020, with a roughly 16-percentage-point advantage as he reclaimed those so-called Rust Belt states, which have been scarred by decades of job losses as companies embraced lower-cost, often nonunion locations. He won Michigan in 2020 by some 154,000 votes. In Michigan, Trump will criticize Biden's economic policies and incentives promoting EVs and say he would do a better job of protecting blue-collar workers if elected to a second term, said Trump adviser Jason Miller. Trump is banking on driving a wedge between union members and their leaders, who criticized the former president's labor policies during his term, labor experts said. Biden's Michigan visit represents the most support a sitting president has shown striking workers since Theodore Roosevelt invited striking coal workers to the White House in 1902, historians said."

MEMA, the Vehicle Suppliers Association, in a letter seen by Reuters urged Biden to ""effectuate federal assistance to ensure the viability of this critical industry sector. Without federal assistance, the ability of the automotive industry to resume full manufacturing capacity is at risk."" The group wants the Biden administration to provide low-interest loans and consider loan forgiveness for struggling small suppliers. Biden is headed to Detroit on Tuesday to show support for striking UAW workers. The White House did not immediately comment and has previously declined to comment on whether it is considering programs to support auto suppliers. The ongoing strikes have already forced some auto suppliers to cut production and furlough some workers. The letter cited ""immediate concern"" for smaller suppliers with revenue of less than $200 million. It urged the Biden administration to establish a Small Business Administration program or other agencies ""to maintain workforce and operational capacity."""
Volkswagen to temporarily cut production of two EV models due to weaker demand -spokesperson,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-temporarily-pause-production-two-ev-car-models-due-drop-demand-2023-09-26/,"FRANKFURT, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) will suspend production of ID.3 and Cupra Born electric cars at its Zwickau and Dresden plants in Germany in the first two weeks of October due to weaker demand, a spokesperson for the carmaker said on Tuesday. Due to the current market situation, vehicle production will be reduced during the autumn holidays in Saxony from Oct. 2 to Oct. 13 at Volkswagen's Zwickau plant, the spokesperson said. Germany's dpa news agency first reported the news. Production of the ID.3 model in Dresden will be suspended from Oct. 2 and resume from Oct. 16 onwards. Volkswagen declined to comment on the number of employees affected. The carmaker said earlier this month that it would not extend the fixed-term contracts of 269 employees at its all-electric Zwickau plant. The German carmaker is facing rising competition from Tesla and a growing array of Chinese automakers, as well as dampened demand in the European EV market due to high inflation and cuts to subsidies."
"Biden vs. Trump in Michigan: Views on unions, the UAW auto strike",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-vs-trump-michigan-views-unions-uaw-auto-strike-2023-09-26/,"Sept 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and 2024 Republican front-runner and former President Donald Trump both travel to Michigan this week to talk to local auto industry workers, as a United Auto Workers' strike spreads around the country. Biden, a Democrat, and Trump are expected to speak to different crowds and present messages that reflect their vastly divergent views on unions, organized labor and the future of the U.S. auto industry. Winning the UAW's support is part of a broader push by both presidential candidates to capture the small-but-influential union vote in the November 2024 election. Michigan trip: Biden is expected on a UAW picket line in Wayne County, where he will meet with UAW President Shawn Fain. Michigan message: Biden is expected to side with striking workers and urge the companies to share their record profits with workers. As President: Biden says support for unions is a cornerstone of his economic policies, and he has pushed investment in U.S. manufacturing tied to union jobs and workers' rights. Biden has backed collective bargaining and union wage increases since taking office, but blocked a railroad workers' strike in 2022, disappointing unions pushing for paid sick leave. Notable quote: Auto companies ""should go further to ensure record corporate profits mean record contracts for the UAW."" Fain said last week: ""We invite and encourage everyone who supports our cause to join us on the picket line from our friends and families all the way up to the president of the United States.” Michigan trip: Trump will speak at Drake Enterprises, a nonunion auto parts supplier in a Detroit suburb, where he will address hundreds of workers. Message in Michigan: Trump will criticize Biden's economic policies and incentives promoting EVs and say he would do a better job of protecting blue-collar workers if elected to a second term. As president: Trump lowered taxes for U.S. companies including the auto giants and appointed people to the National Labor Relations Board who unions say weakened protections for workers. Previously as a real estate developer, Trump faced lawsuits in which contractors accused him of not fully paying for their work. Notable union quote: ""If the UAW 'leadership' doesn't ENDORSE me, and if I don't win the Election, the Autoworkers are 'toast,' with our great truckers to follow,"" Trump said on Truth Social. Fain says: ""Every fiber of our union is being poured into fighting the billionaire class and an economy that enriches people like Donald Trump at the expense of workers."""
Canadian union Unifor names GM its second bargaining target among Detroit Three,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/canadian-union-unifor-names-gm-its-second-bargaining-target-among-detroit-three-2023-09-25/,"Sept 25 (Reuters) - Canadian union Unifor announced General Motors (GM.N) as its second bargaining target in contract talks with the Detroit Three on Monday, a day after ratifying a new three-year contract with Ford Motor (F.N). Unifor had set Ford as the first target for a pattern agreement in its contract discussions with the Detroit Three in Canada. On Sunday, the union voted in favor of a new contract with Ford that offers wage increases of up to 25% to about 5,600 workers at the automaker's Canadian facilities. ""Bargaining committees will now work to negotiate the pattern-setting agreement ratified by members at Ford of Canada in addition to GM-specific issues in this second round of talks,"" Unifor said. Talks with GM are set to begin on Tuesday, the union said. Meanwhile, in the United States, negotiators for the United Auto Workers and Ford continued bargaining, with ""significant gaps to close on the key economic issues,"" the automaker said. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, plans to visit a UAW picket line in Michigan on Tuesday. Biden said on Monday that the UAW gave up an ""incredible amount"" in 2007 when the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. ""They saved the automobile industry,"" Biden said, referring to the union. ""Now that the industry is roaring back, they should participate in the benefit of that."" Republican U.S. Senator Josh Hawley visited a UAW picket line outside a GM plant in Missouri on Monday. ""These workers deserve better pay, better benefits, and a GUARANTEE their jobs will stay in America,"" Hawley said in a social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Republican former President Donald Trump also plans to make a speech in Michigan on auto issues on Wednesday. The UAW has historically chosen one U.S. automaker to focus on reaching a contract deal that has typically set a pattern for the other automakers but this year has been negotiating with all three simultaneously. Ford became the de facto lead company, following the union's statement on Friday that sufficient progress had been made at the No. 2 U.S. automaker to avoid the ordering of further walkouts at the company. The UAW launched strikes at 38 GM and Stellantis STLAM.MI parts distribution operations in 20 U.S. states on Friday. Those walkouts threaten to choke off supplies of repair parts to dealers and customers. The Canadian operations of the Detroit Three are much smaller than their U.S. setups, but the three automakers each have critical factories in Canada."
Ford says 'significant gaps' remain in UAW labor contract talks,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-says-significant-gaps-remain-reach-uaw-contract-deal-2023-09-25/,"Sept 24 (Reuters) - Ford Motor (F.N) said on Sunday that despite progress in some areas, it still has ""significant gaps to close"" on key economic issues before it can reach a new labor agreement with the United Auto Workers union. The ""issues are interconnected and must work within an overall agreement that supports our mutual success,"" it said in a late evening statement after talks over the weekend. The UAW, which on Friday cited ""real progress"" in talks with the No. 2 U.S. automaker, did not immediately comment. In contrast to Ford, the UAW has expanded strikes against General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler-parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) to 38 parts distribution centers across the United States. It was not immediately clear if main table bargaining took place with GM and Stellantis over the weekend. The UAW began unprecedented, simultaneous strikes on Sept. 15 at one assembly plant each of the Detroit Three after the prior four-year labor deals expired. The strikes at additional GM and Stellantis facilities on Friday added about 5,600 workers to the 12,700 previously on strike. UAW President Shawn Fain said Friday that Ford had improved its contract offer, including boosting profit sharing and agreeing to let workers strike over plant closures but said the union still had serious issues to resolve. The Detroit Three automakers have proposed 20% raises over 4-1/2 years, while the UAW is seeking 40% along with 32-hour-work weeks, the return of defined benefit pensions and to eliminate wage gaps separating newer and older employees. President Joe Biden will travel to Michigan Tuesday to show support for workers and visit a UAW picket line, while Donald Trump who is seeking a new term as president will speak in Clinton Township, Michigan Wednesday about the UAW strike. GM said last week it was forced to idle its Kansas car plant because of a parts shortage stemming from the strike, which led it to temporarily furlough 2,000 workers in Kansas. Stellantis temporarily laid off 68 employees in Ohio last week and expects to furlough another 300 workers in Indiana because of the strike."
US asks Mexico for fresh workers' rights review at auto parts facility,https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-asks-mexico-review-workers-rights-teklas-automotive-facility-2023-09-25/,"MEXICO CITY, Sept 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. made another appeal to Mexico to review alleged labor violations under a regional trade pact on Monday, with the latest investigation centered on a Teklas Automotive facility in the Mexican state of Aguascalientes. The latest review marks the U.S. Trade Representative office's 14th labor rights complaint against facilities in Mexico since the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade took effect in 2020, including nine this year. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the request was intended to ""address a serious violation of workers' rights"" at the automotive parts factory, involving an employer possibly terminating workers for engaging in union activity. ""Today's action underscores the United States' unceasing commitment to using the tools established in the USMCA to protect workers' rights to organize for and join the union of their choice,"" Tai said in a statement. Teklas, which was founded in the 1970s in Turkey and later expanded to Europe, North America, and China, calls itself a ""leading"" global supplier of automotive fluid systems with 12 plants in six countries, according to its website. Washington wants the Mexican government to review the matter under the USMCA's Rapid Response Labor Mechanism. The Mexican government has ten days to review the U.S. request, and if it accepts, another 45 days to investigate the case. Mexico has recently denied two requests for probes into labor rights concerns, rejecting a U.S. call to review Grupo Yazaki's auto components factory in the state of Guanajuato and also a Grupo Mexico mine labor probe. Teklas did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
Inside Vietnam's plans to dent China's rare earths dominance,https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/inside-vietnams-plans-dent-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-2023-09-25/,"HANOI, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Vietnam plans to restart its biggest rare-earths mine next year with a Western-backed project that could rival the world's largest, according to two companies involved, as part of a broader push to dent China's dominance in a sector that helps power advanced technologies. The move would be a step toward the Southeast Asian country's aim of building up a rare-earths supply chain, including developing its capacity to refine ores into metals used in magnets for electric vehicles, smartphones and wind turbines. As an initial step, Vietnam's government intends to launch tenders for multiple blocks of its Dong Pao mine before the year's end, said Tessa Kutscher, an executive at Australia's Blackstone Minerals Ltd (BSX.AX), which plans to bid for at least one concession. She cited unpublished information from Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, which did not respond to requests for comment. The auction's timing could change but the government plans to restart the mine next year, said Luu Anh Tuan, chairman of Vietnam Rare Earth JSC (VTRE), the country's main refiner and Blackstone's partner in the project. The proposed restart of Dong Pao - whose timeline, scale and degree of foreign financial support have not been reported previously - comes as many nations fret about their vulnerability to supply disruptions due to China's stranglehold on strategic minerals and its disputes with the U.S. and its allies. Beijing this year imposed export curbs on minor metals used in semiconductors, which an influential Chinese policy adviser warned was ""just a start"". Vietnam has the second-largest rare-earth deposits, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. But they have remained largely untapped, with investment discouraged by low prices that are effectively set by China because of its near-monopoly on the global market. Visiting Hanoi this month to upgrade bilateral relations, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an agreement to boost Vietnam's ability to lure investors for its rare-earth reserves. In interviews with Reuters, 12 industry executives, investors, analysts and foreign officials described plans for Vietnam, including investments they said showed how talk of derisking supply chains to reduce reliance on China is translating into action. Some acknowledged the difficulties of forging a rare-earths hub but said the gambit could make Vietnam a viable player while assuaging strategic worries, even if China remained dominant. Kutscher said Blackstone's investment in the project would be worth around $100 million if it wins. She added that the company was talking to potential clients, including electric car makers VinFast and Rivian (RIVN.O), about possible contracts with set prices that would shield suppliers from fluctuations and guarantee buyers a secure supply chain. Sealing such deals would address a hurdle faced by developers in Vietnam. In recent years, Japanese investors Toyota Tsusho and Sojitz abandoned projects at Dong Pao after China ramped up supply, pummelling prices. The Japanese firms did not respond to requests for comment. Yet despite the focus on derisking, it is unclear whether clients would be ready to pay a premium for Vietnam, said Dylan Kelly, of investment firm Terra Capital, noting the market in general was opaque. Asked about VinFast's potential involvement, a spokesperson for parent company Vingroup said the group's entity in charge of raw-material procurement, VinES, had no current plans with Blackstone involving rare earths. He did not address subsequent questions about VinFast specifically. Rivian did not reply to a request for comment. Effective exploitation of Dong Pao - which has sat dormant for at least seven years, according to an official at state-controlled miner Lavreco, which owns a concession - would propel Vietnam into the top league of rare-earths producers. But refining rare earths is complex, and China controls many processing technologies. Dong Pao's estimated deposits also need to be reassessed with modern methods, according to Blackstone. Still, rare earths at Dong Pao are relatively easy to access and are mostly concentrated in bastnaesite ores, according to the Hanoi University of Mining and Geology. These are typically rich in cerium, used in flat screens, and lanthanides, such as praseodymium and neodymium, which go into magnets. Tuan said VTRE hoped to win a concession that would allow it to extract about 10,000 metric tons of rare-earth oxide (REO) equivalent a year, roughly one-third of the mine's expected annual output. Production could start around the end of 2024, he said. That would put Dong Pao's output slightly below that of California's Mountain Pass, one of the world's largest mines, which produced 43,000 metric tons of REO equivalent in 2022, according to the USGS. Vietnam also plans to develop additional mines. In July, Hanoi set a target to produce up to 60,000 tons of REO equivalent a year by 2030. China set a domestic quota of 210,000 tons last year. Those goals would see Vietnam producing 5% to 15% of China's projected output by the decade's end, said David Merriman, a research analyst at consultancy Project Blue, who expects China to increase production over that period. Vietnam's targets were ""ambitious, though they are not entirely out of the question"", he said. The U.S. agreed during Biden's visit to help Vietnam better map its rare-earths resources and ""attract quality investment"", according to a White House fact sheet, a move that could encourage U.S. investors to bid for Vietnam's new concessions. Reuters could not determine whether concrete plans involving U.S. investors exist at this stage. Officials at the U.S. embassy in Hanoi, the White House and Department of Commerce did not reply to requests for comment. But recent U.S. attempts to gain a foothold in the Vietnamese industry did not succeed, said John Rockhold, a consultant to the rare-earths sector and president of the Hanoi chapter of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, adding that one such plan involving VTRE collapsed this year. That plan would have involved the shipment to the U.S. of rare earths refined by VTRE and possible future investment in Vietnam of $200 million, according to a non-public report for unspecified U.S. investors seen by Reuters. VTRE confirmed the shipment deal had foundered. Instead, VTRE in April announced a deal to supply 100 metric tons of rare-earth oxides this year to Australian Strategic Materials (ASM.AX). ASM declined to comment on Dong Pao's exploitation. Blackstone, which is a partner in that deal, operates a nickel mine in Vietnam and has determined that its processing facility in the country could handle ore from Dong Pao, according to a company statement. Ultimately, VTRE plans to play a role in the whole rare-earth industry from ore extraction to the final products, said Tuan, who with his wife owns most VTRE shares, according to a list of shareholders he showed to Reuters. Blackstone said the ownership information accorded with its assessment following due diligence. This is not an easy feat. The U.S. currently exports its rare-earth ores to China for processing as it lacks its own facilities. An existing VTRE factory in northern Vietnam specialises in separating rare-earth oxides from the extracted ore. The plant has capacity to process 5,000 tons of REO a year but the company plans to treble that to accommodate input from Dong Pao, Tuan said. Once separated, oxides are turned into metals for use in magnets and other industrial applications. The metallization process is controlled by China, which produces 90% of rare-earth metals, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. But VTRE is running a pilot project to build a metallization factory with South Korea's Setopia (222810.KQ), said Setopia, which has no previous experience in the sector. The initial combined investment would be around $4 million, mostly from Setopia, a Setopia official told Reuters, with a plant possibly ready next year. In the downstream industry, South Korean and Chinese magnet firms are set to open factories in Vietnam, Reuters reported in August. Dudley Kingsnorth, a professor at the Western Australian School of Mines at Curtin University, said Vietnam had some way to go, including in improving environmental practices, to realise its rare-earth goals. Still, he said, Vietnam ""has the resources, the mining and processing expertise to provide alternatives to China""."
Unifor says Ford offers wage increases of 10% for first year,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/canadian-union-unifor-says-ford-offers-wage-increases-10-first-year-2023-09-23/,"Sept 23 (Reuters) - Ford Motor (F.N) has offered Canadian union Unifor wage increases of up to 25% in its tentative agreement, the union said on Saturday. The agreement provides a 10% wage increase for the first year followed by increases of 2% and 3% through the second and third year and a $10,000 productivity and quality bonus to all employees on the active roll of the company, Unifor said. The proposals also include an increase in the monthly basic benefit and special allowance in all class codes across defined benefit and hybrid pension plans and investments to help transition from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle production to electric vehicle (EV) assembly facilities. Unifor, which represents about 5,600 Canadian auto workers, on Friday said that its Ford leadership group has voted unanimously to support the tentative agreement. Ford is also in the midst of contract negotiations in the U.S. with a strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union at its at the automaker's Wayne, Michigan assembly plant. The UAW began strikes on Friday against 38 parts distribution centers across the United States at GM and Stellantis, extending its unprecedented, simultaneous strikes that began with one assembly plant each of the Detroit Three. The additional facilities added about 5,600 workers to the 12,700 already on strike. The UAW said on Friday that Ford had improved its contract offer, including boosting profit sharing and agreeing to let workers strike over plant closures but said the union still has ""serious issues"" with Ford and its workers would remain on strike at the automaker's Wayne, Michigan assembly plant. Unlike UAW, Unifor chose one of the Detroit Three as a ""target"" to negotiate with first - in this case, Ford - in a pattern bargaining tactic used to set the tone for subsequent deals with other companies. UAW President Shawn Fain said in a Facebook live event that by targeting distribution centers the strike becomes a nationwide event. He said he expected talks to continue through the weekend. The standoff is fueling worries about prolonged industrial action that could disrupt production and dent U.S. economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday showed significant support by Americans for the striking auto workers. U.S. President Joe Biden said in a social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he would come to Michigan on Tuesday ""to join the picket line and stand in solidarity with the men and women of UAW,"" while former President Donald Trump, who is seeking a new term, will be in Michigan on Wednesday to address auto workers, his campaign said."
"Biden to visit Michigan to support auto strike, a day before Trump",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-visit-uaw-strike-would-be-historic-move-by-us-president-2023-09-22/,"WASHINGTON/TOLEDO, Ohio, Sept 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will travel to Michigan on Tuesday to show support for the United Auto Workers' strike against Detroit automakers, putting him in the center of the dispute that has pitted his labor allies against major manufacturers. Biden, a Democrat, sees himself as a pro-union president and his visit to the state, a day before former President Donald Trump is scheduled to be there, will underscore his support for union workers' right to take action and engage in collective bargaining. ""Tuesday, I’ll go to Michigan to join the picket line and stand in solidarity with the men and women of UAW as they fight for a fair share of the value they helped create,"" Biden said on Friday in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. ""It’s time for a win-win agreement that keeps American auto manufacturing thriving with well-paid UAW jobs."" Biden is running for re-election in 2024 and will likely face Trump, who is the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination. A spokesperson for Trump's campaign said Biden's trip to Michigan was ""a cheap photo op."" ""The only reason Biden is going to Michigan on Tuesday is because President Trump announced he is going on Wednesday,"" the Trump campaign said in a statement late on Friday. The UAW on Friday invited Biden to visit workers on its picket lines, and said that it would expand its Detroit strike to parts distribution centers across the United States at General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI). The company said it has made real progress in talks with Ford Motor (F.N). ""It’s very rare for a president to visit strikers,"" said Jeremi Suri, a historian and presidential scholar at the University of Texas at Austin. He added that even pro-labor Democratic President Jimmy Carter never visited a picket line. ""This would be a major, major shift for Biden to identify the presidency with striking workers, rather than siding with industry or staying above the fray."" Numerous unions have already endorsed Biden's re-election, but the UAW has for now withheld its endorsement. Biden said the automakers should ""go further to ensure record corporate profits mean record contracts for the UAW,"" echoing sentiments by union leaders. Both the Detroit Three and the UAW have a lot at stake from federal policy decisions. The automakers are counting on Washington for billions in subsidies for electric-vehicle production. They are negotiating with the Biden administration over future emissions rules that require a shift to EVs that the industry believes would be too fast and too expensive. The union, meanwhile, is concerned that the transition to EVs will mean a loss of jobs as those vehicles require fewer parts in production. Trump plans to travel to Detroit to speak at a rally advertised for auto workers as he tries to win back some blue-collar voters who defected to Biden in his victory in 2020. Trump has called for rank-and-file union workers to ignore their leaders. Trump has not said if he will visit the picket lines. United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain blasted Trump earlier in the week, saying the union was ""fighting the billionaire class and an economy that enriches people like Donald Trump at the expense of workers."" The last U.S. president to show such support for striking workers was probably Theodore Roosevelt, Suri said. In 1902, Roosevelt invited striking coal workers to the White House with government officials and management, concerned that the country faced a coal shortage. Ahead of the precedent-shattering meeting, Roosevelt, like Biden, found himself with little leverage to negotiate. ""There is literally nothing ... the national government has any power to do,"" Roosevelt complained to U.S. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, according to a recounting of the strike on the Department of Labor website. ""I am at wit's end how to proceed."" Workers on the picket lines had mixed feelings over whether Biden should visit. Some said politicians should stay out of the fray, while others said they would welcome the support if the strike continued. “Me personally, I wouldn’t mind if Biden stepped up and showed some support,"" said Laura Zielinski, 55, of Toledo, Ohio, on Tuesday, noting Biden's visit to the Stellantis Toledo assembly plant in 2010 while he served as vice president. ""Support like that would put a spotlight on the talks - kind of give a nudge to the companies.” Thomas Morris, 60, who was on a picket line in the Philadelphia suburbs, said he appreciated Biden's support of unions and calls for corporations to pass along record profits to workers and consumers. He would love to see Biden join. ""It would bring a lot of publicity and help the fight,"" Morris said."
"UAW strikes more GM, Stellantis facilities, cites Ford progress",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/detroit-three-automakers-enter-final-hours-avoid-wider-uaw-strike-2023-09-22/,"DETROIT, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers expanded its strikes against Detroit automakers General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI), but kept its Ford (F.N) walkout limited to a single plant due to progress made in talks, the union said on Friday. The auto workers' union began strikes at noon EDT (1600 GMT) on Friday against 38 parts distribution centers across the United States at GM and Stellantis, extending its unprecedented, simultaneous strikes that began with one assembly plant each of the Detroit Three. The additional facilities added about 5,600 workers to the 12,700 already on strike. UAW President Shawn Fain said in a Facebook live event that by targeting distribution centers the strike becomes a nationwide event. He said he expected talks to continue through the weekend. Hours after Fain invited President Joe Biden to visit a picket line, Biden said in a social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he would come to Michigan on Tuesday ""to join the picket line and stand in solidarity with the men and women of UAW."" He added: ""It’s time for a win-win agreement that keeps American auto manufacturing thriving with well-paid UAW jobs."" The president has been vocal in his support for the union's demands for better pay and benefits. Former President Donald Trump, who is seeking a new term, will be in Michigan on Wednesday to address auto workers, his campaign said. Fain said the decision on the expanded strike would impact consumers trying to obtain repair parts. The distribution centers are warehouses that ship parts to dealers and other retailers for use in repairs. ""We will be everywhere from California to Massachusetts, from Oregon to Florida."" At a GM parts distribution center outside Philadelphia, picketing workers said the strike will result in cars sitting longer for repairs but that is the only way to get the higher wages they seek. ""If you look at the past few years, car prices went up 30% but our wages went up 6%. We are not the problem,"" said Thomas Morris, 60, who has worked at the center in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, for the past four decades. ""I understand it’s going to cost some pain for people, but we are just looking for fairness."" Fain said they have more work to do at Ford, but ""we do want to recognize that Ford is showing they're serious about reaching a deal."" He added: ""Stellantis and GM in particular are going to need some serious pushing."" He also threatened more action at Stellantis' critical parts plants in his hometown of Kokomo, Indiana. Stellantis has four factories in Kokomo that make engines and transmissions used widely across the automaker's product line. Stellantis has said it wants to be able to consolidate and close some of its parts distribution centers. Fain said Ford had improved its contract offer, including boosting profit sharing and agreeing to let workers strike over plant closures but said the union still has ""serious issues"" with Ford. GM said in a statement that UAW leaders are ""manipulating the bargaining process for their own personal agendas"" and called the strike escalation ""unnecessary."" Stellantis said on Thursday it made a ""very competitive offer"" and said the union's leadership seems ""more concerned about pursuing their own political agendas."" GM, which said it had contingency plans it did not specify to protect its business and customers, said it has made five separate offers to the union. Ford said it is continuing to negotiate, adding that ""we have more work ahead of us before we can reach an agreement."" Nearly 13,000 UAW workers walked out at plants in Missouri, Michigan and Ohio on Sept 15. Those plants produce the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, alongside other popular models. But Ford and Canadian union Unifor reached a last-minute deal to avoid a walkout on Tuesday. Unifor's Ford leadership unanimously endorsed the tentative agreement late on Friday. Ratification meetings for members were set for Saturday, Unifor said. Wedbush Analyst Daniel Ives said this latest move by the UAW marks a divergence in the talks with the automakers. ""The current deal is a torpedo to the business models of the Detroit 3,"" he said. ""To take a deal just to avoid a strike and get it done is great for the next 24 hours but a nightmare for the next 30 years."" Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said Ford's family-controlled structure gives it a different focus than the other two. ""GM and Stellantis are looking at stockholder value and Ford is looking a lot more long-term that they have to make friends with labor."" The standoff is fueling worries about prolonged industrial action that could disrupt production and dent U.S. economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday showed significant support by Americans for the striking auto workers. The automakers have proposed 20% raises over 4-1/2 years, while the UAW is seeking 40%. The union also wants to eliminate wage gaps separating newer and older employees, as well as workers in certain component operations and those in assembly plants. Fain said on Friday that the union had negotiated the elimination of lower wage tiers in some components facilities at Ford and GM. But Stellantis has not agreed to raise wages at its MOPAR component operations, Fain said."
UAW union files labor complaint against US Senator Tim Scott,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-union-files-labor-complaint-against-us-senator-tim-scott-2023-09-23/,"WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union has filed a labor complaint against Republican presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Tim Scott after his suggestion that auto workers on strike should be terminated. Shawn Fain, the president of UAW, filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, claiming Scott's remarks earlier this week violated federal labor law and in making those remarks he was in violation of the right to strike. At a campaign event on Monday, Scott said: ""I think (former U.S. President) Ronald Reagan gave us a great example when federal employees decided they were going to strike. He said, you strike, you're fired. Simple concept to me. ... To the extent that we can use that once again, absolutely."" Scott doubled down on Friday after the complaint against him and said UAW ""is one of the most corrupt and scandal-plagued unions"" in the United States. ""They want to threaten me & shut me up. They don't scare me,"" he said on messaging platform X. * The United Auto Workers expanded its strikes against Detroit automakers General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI), but kept its Ford (F.N) walkout limited to a single plant due to progress made in talks, the union said on Friday. * The auto workers' union began strikes at noon ET (1600 GMT) on Friday against 38 parts distribution centers across the United States at GM and Stellantis, extending its unprecedented, simultaneous strikes that began with one assembly plant at each of the Detroit Three.

Breakingviews: Carmakers will blink first in union standoff,https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/carmakers-will-blink-first-union-standoff-2023-09-22/,"NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Detroit will run out of road before its unions do. The United Auto Workers have called for expanded strikes at General Motors (GM.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI), sparing Ford Motor (F.N) thanks to progress in their talks. A selective truce might help labor’s rainy-day fund last longer. Shutdowns threaten far more pain for the automakers holding out. Talks between the two sides over pay and benefits were deadlocked until UAW boss Shawn Fain said on Friday that they had made “real progress” with Ford. GM and Stellantis, meanwhile, continue to draw ire. Fain called for work stoppages at 38 parts distribution centers at both companies. Dividing and conquering makes sense. If the UAW's 146,000 members all downed tools, their $500 a week in strike pay would drain the organization's $825 million of coffers in 11 weeks. Leaving Ford out would add two extra months to the fund’s life even if impasses at the other two companies spiral into full shutdowns. The impact of such closures would fall heavily on the refuseniks. In 2019, when a UAW strike closed manufacturing at GM for 40 days, it reduced output by 300,000 vehicles and operating profit by $3.6 billion. If today’s costs were similar, it would shave around $1.7 billion in operating profit every month, 13% of GM’s expected total this year, based on Wells Fargo estimates and LSEG data. Cash flow would be a bigger issue. The strike four years ago ate away $5.4 billion at GM. That would devour three-quarters of the cash the company’s automotive operations are supposed to throw off this year. Plus, it has nearly $30 billion in short-term bills to start paying off soon. Ford is not off the hook: Serious issues remain between the two sides, and the ongoing walkout at one of its plants could cost as much as $48 million a week, or $2.5 billion if it drags on for a year, using 2019 as a guide. Even a slow bleed is a powerful threat. The crux of negotiations probably will come down to wages, where Fain said Ford has budged, including the reinstatement of cost-of-living increases. With the UAW prepared to endure, Detroit will be pressured to blink. (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

At GM and Stellantis, it's a different story."" In detail, he said: At Ford: ** Rawsonville components and Sterling Axle employees will now be on the same wage scale as assembly workers. The UAW is aiming to end all tiers that pay different wages for similar work. ** UAW won reinstatement of the cost of living allowance that was suspended in 2009. ** Won agreement to provide employees with right to strike over plant closures during the life of the contract. ** Won additional job security for UAW members in the event of a layoff. Members including temporary workers will receive income security for up to two years with healthcare. ** Won an enhanced profit-sharing formula that would have resulted in a 13.3% increase for average employee in payouts last year. ** Won immediate conversion of all current temporary workers to permanent employees and all temporary workers will receive profit sharing after 90 days service of Ford. ** ""No concessions on the table"" from UAW, Fain said. At General Motors: ** Fain said UAW ended wage tiers at some GM component facilities. UAW ""won a serious victory at CCA (Customer Care and Aftersales) and GMCH (GM Components Holdings) and we have killed those wage tiers. Those workers will now be on the same wage scale as assembly workers."" ** GM is offering a ""deficient"" cost-of-living allowance that is projected to provide zero increases to employees over the next four years. ** GM rejected all of UAW's job security proposals. ** GM rejected all of the union's profit sharing proposals. ** GM rejected proposals to convert temporary workers to permanent. At Stellantis: ** Stellantis is offering a ""deficient"" cost-of-living allowance that is projected to provide zero increases to employees over the next four years. ** Stellantis rejected all of UAW's job security proposals. ** Stellantis rejected all of the union's profit-sharing proposals. ** Stellantis rejected proposals to convert temporary workers."
"UAW expands strikes against GM, Stellantis",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/view-uaw-expands-strikes-against-gm-stellantis-2023-09-22/,"Sept 22 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said on Friday it would expand its coordinated strike against General Motors Co (GM.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI) but added that it had made real progress in talks with Ford Motor (F.N). The escalation comes as the labor group and the automakers remain apart on terms of a new contract covering 146,000 workers. Here is what industry experts are saying about the expansion of the strike that began last week: BRANDON PIZZURRO, DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC INVESTMENTS AT GUIDESTONE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: ""Any type of thawing in the talks between the unions and the automakers is worth cheering since they employ a lot of people, certainly the large companies such as Ford that do have an impact on supply chains and everything else. So, when you can see them maybe coming to a resolution, clearly the stock is reacting positively to that potential news that allows them to get over the hurdle of getting workers back in the factory."" DANIEL IVES, ANALYST AT WEDBUSH SECURITIES: ""This becomes a full on tidal wave of strikes for GM and Stellantis. Now the worst case fears are coming true."" ""This is like union 101 in terms of divide and conquer and put more pressure on GM and Stellantis. But devil's in the details because if Ford took a nightmare deal that could potentially derail their business model permanently."" ""I think GM and Stellantis are going to fight this. There are business model differences with Ford and they have more to lose."" ARTHUR WHEATON, DIRECTOR OF LABOR STUDIES AT CORNELL'S SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS: ""I think it is a great strategy going after the distribution centers."" ""Car dealerships make money off of people coming in to service their cars. That's how they make a lot of their money."" ""Ford has a very long history of having much better labor relations skills and relationship with the union than either General Motors or what's now called Stellantis. Way ahead."" ""If they get that deal at Ford, there's a good chance they will be able to get most of that if not all of that at GM and then my fingers are crossed they'll get something good at Stellantis. But I am less confident Stellantis can work it out because they are by far the worst of the three with labor relations."" ITAY MICHAELI, ANALYST AT CITI RESEARCH: ""The reported progress at Ford is encouraging, suggesting that the Detroit Three could perhaps reach a labor agreement sooner than some have been expecting (i.e. day/weeks, not months) - though it does appear much work remains to be done."" ""Relative to a scenario of all-out strikes at full-size truck plants, today’s update seems somewhat more encouraging in terms of a likely immediate incremental financial impact and overall negotiation status."" SAM FIORANI, VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL VEHICLE FORECASTING AT AUTOFORECAST SOLUTIONS: ""The corporate structure of GM and Stellantis are more public-shareholder focused, whereas Ford's stockholders are largely one family. It acts like more of a privately owned company than the other two. GM and Stellantis are looking at stockholder value and Ford is looking a lot more long-term that they have to make friends with (workers)."" ""The fact that Ford was left out of this current wave of new strikes is a sign that the UAW is starting to look at this as a negotiation and not as the war they set it up to be. This puts pressure on GM and Stellantis to come up with some proposals that are closer to what Ford already has."" ""Hopefully, since Ford is in the lead, it'll get them to the table to finalize an agreement, which can be a blueprint for the others and get us back towards normal industry."" MARICK MASTERS, PROFESSOR OF BUSINESS, WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY: ""I think the parties have shown some movement, and that there is a deal that can be looked upon as something that could result in the ending of this strike."" ANDREA KUPFER SCHNEIDER, PROFESSOR OF LAW AND DIRECTOR OF THE KUKIN PROGRAM FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION: ""In sort of the divide and conquer, or at least in demonstrating that there are rewards to Ford, and thereby signaling to others that when some of the demands are met, it's not that the strike against Ford is ending, but that at least it will not expand. And so it also allows the union the flexibility to really ratchet up the strike, or ratchet down the strike in very nuanced ways."""

The ongoing strike is the first-ever simultaneous labor action against General Motors (GM.N), Ford Motor (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) after the UAW's contracts expired more than a week ago. The automakers, like their global counterparts, have been focused on cost reductions, which in some cases include job cuts, to help accelerate a shift to electric vehicles (EVs) from gasoline-powered vehicles. The UAW, which represents 46,000 GM workers, 57,000 Ford employees and 43,000 Stellantis workers, kicked off negotiations with the companies in July. The union historically has picked one of the Detroit Three to negotiate with first as the so-called target that sets the pattern on which subsequent deals are based. This time, UAW President Shawn Fain targeted all three companies simultaneously. Contract talks between the UAW and the Detroit automakers in past years had gone on until the strike deadline and beyond. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found significant support by Americans for the striking auto workers. The initial walkout of 12,700 workers was smaller than some analysts expected, with only three assembly plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri targeted. Those plants build the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, along with other popular models. The second round of strikes will expand to 38 locations across 20 states in all nine regions of the UAW, focusing on parts distribution centers. The union previously rejected the companies' offers. It has demanded a 40% wage hike, including a 20% immediate increase, and improvements in benefits. ""If they’ve got money for Wall Street, they sure as hell have money for the workers making the product,"" UAW President Shawn Fain has said. Fain said on Friday ""Stellantis and GM in particular are going to need some serious pushing."" He added they have more work to do at Ford, but ""we do want to recognize that Ford is showing they're serious about reaching a deal."" The three automakers currently have proposed 20% raises over four-and-a-half years. In an opinion piece published in the Detroit Free Press, GM President Mark Reuss called the UAW's demands for a 40% pay hike ""untenable,"" signaling the two sides remain far apart over the key issue. On Friday, Fain said Ford has improved its offer, which includes right to strike over plant closures, additional job security in the event of layoffs and enhanced profit sharing formula. The industrial action hit the Detroit Three automakers as they ramp up efforts to maximize gasoline and EV vehicle production to capitalize on demand for new vehicles. A full strike would hit earnings at each affected automaker by about $400 million to $500 million per week assuming all production was lost, Deutsche Bank previously estimated. Some losses could be recouped by boosting production schedules later, but that possibility fades if a strike extends to weeks or months. In fiscal 2019, GM's fourth-quarter profit took a $3.6 billion hit from a 40-day UAW strike. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimated in a Thursday research note that a full month of lost production would cost the three automakers $7 billion to $8 billion in lost profits. The UAW is pushing automakers to eliminate the two-tier wage system under which new hires can earn far less than veterans. Fain has said repeatedly that the union will push to restore pay improvements tied to the cost of living and retiree benefits cut during the 2008-2009 economic crisis. The UAW wants strong salary increases, given the financial success of the automakers, citing generous executive payouts and large U.S. federal subsidies for EV sales. The union also wants defined benefit pensions for all workers restored, 32-hour work weeks, job security guarantees and an end to the use of temporary workers. Fain also is aiming to get agreements that would allow the UAW to represent hourly workers at joint-venture EV battery plants opened or planned by the Detroit Three. The UAW has been wary of the industry shift to EVs and called on the Biden administration to soften its proposed vehicle emission cuts that would require 67% of new vehicles to be electric by 2032. The union has yet to endorse a candidate in the next U.S. presidential election. EVs require fewer parts to build, and industry officials have said that will result in a need for fewer workers. Fain has said there should be no jobs lost because of the EV shift. The Detroit Three want to close the cost gap they have with foreign automakers with non-unionized U.S. factories. Ford sources estimate that their U.S. labor costs are $64 an hour, compared with an estimated $55 for foreign automakers and $45 to $50 for EV leader Tesla (TSLA.O). The companies also want greater flexibility in how they use their U.S. workforces to increase efficiency and cut costs as the industry shifts to EVs."

Auto workers rally as deadline nears to expand strikes on Detroit Three,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/detroit-three-under-pressure-progress-uaw-talks-avoid-wider-auto-strikes-2023-09-21/,"CHICAGO, Sept 21 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers (UAW) members rallied against the Detroit Three automakers in multiple U.S. states on Thursday afternoon as Friday's deadline loomed for a threatened expansion of the union's strikes. The seven-day standoff is fueling worries about prolonged industrial action that could disrupt production and ripple through the supply chain and dent U.S. economic growth. The UAW last week launched unprecedented, simultaneous strikes at one assembly plant each of General Motors (GM.N), Ford (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI). Approximately 12,700 workers are on strike as a result of the UAW's coordinated U.S. action out of the union's 146,000 members who work at the Big Three. ""If we have to drag this thing out in order to stand up, we will,"" Ayanna Dixon, a 13-year auto worker and union steward told a crowd near a Ford plant in southeast Chicago under gray skies. ""The raise itself to me will be setting an example for my children,"" she said. The Chicago plant has not been shut down by the strike and about 100 workers and supporters rallied, holding signs including ""Stand up, End Tiers"". UAW workers want to end a tiered wage structure that they say has created a large gap between newer and older employees, forcing some to work two jobs to make ends meet. In Louisville, Kentucky, at least a couple of hundred workers, family members and supporters gathered at a parking lot near one of Ford's two local assembly plants in support of workers striking elsewhere. Passing cars honked in support and after some speeches, members of the group held hands and sang union songs. UAW President Shawn Fain has promised an expansion of the strikes at 12 p.m. EDT on Friday (1600 GMT), barring ""serious progress"" in talks. On Thursday morning, Fain posted a video message on X, formerly known as Twitter, to UAW members about the Friday deadline, showing scenes from several Hollywood movies with the characters saying ""tick tock."" GM said it remained in talks with the UAW on Thursday. Ford said its negotiations continue. Stellantis said on Wednesday it made a fifth offer to the UAW on Tuesday dealing with subcommittee demands, and a source familiar with the talks said those talks continued on Thursday. The White House declined to say on Thursday if President Joe Biden will visit a picket line but said he is ""pro-UAW workers."" ""We appreciate the fact that they still are at the negotiating table,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. Meanwhile, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found significant support by Americans for the striking auto workers. Stellantis, GM and Ford have furloughed some employees at other factories because of the ripple effects of the strikes, including parts shortages, storage constraints and other issues. Analysts expect plants that build high-margin pickup trucks such as Ford's F-150, GM's Chevy Silverado and Stellantis' Ram to be the next targets if the walkout continues. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimated in a Thursday research note that a full month of lost production would cost the three automakers $7 billion to $8 billion in lost profits. Fain has said Detroit automakers have not shared their huge profits with workers while enriching executives and investors. GM President Mark Reuss on Wednesday rejected claims by the union that the record profits made by automakers go toward fueling ""corporate greed,"" saying the funds have been reinvested in electric vehicles as well as gasoline-powered cars. In an opinion piece published in the Detroit Free Press, Reuss also called the UAW's demands for a 40% pay hike ""untenable,"" signaling the two sides remain far apart over the key issue. The three automakers have proposed 20% raises over 4-1/2 years. S&P said the strikes were highly likely to last several weeks, potentially cutting third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product by 0.39% and causing ""upheaval"" across global automotive supply chains. The impact of the strikes has begun to spread to suppliers. On Thursday, BorgWarner (BWA.N) said any hit on sales is expected to be relatively modest initially. However, it added that if the strikes were to continue for several weeks or expand to affect other customer plants the impact would be larger. The ongoing walkout at mid-sized truck factories benefits rival Toyota Motor (7203.T), which does not have unions at its U.S. factories and is about to launch redesigned Tacoma pickup trucks, S&P added. Tesla TSLA.O investors have said a potential hike in wages and benefits at Detroit competitors would widen the EV giant's labor cost structure advantages."
Faraday Future names insider Matthias Aydt its new global CEO,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/faraday-future-names-insider-matthias-aydt-new-global-ceo-2023-09-21/,"Sept 21 (Reuters) - Faraday Future Intelligent Electric (FFIE.O) on Thursday named company insider Matthias Aydt its new global CEO, effective Sept. 29, as the troubled EV maker focuses on boosting production and generating revenue. Aydt, who has been with Faraday Future for over seven years, will replace Xuefeng Chen, who took the top job at the company in November last year. Chen will resume his prior duties as CEO of Faraday Future's China business and also take on a new role as the company's EVP of Global Industrialization. Aydt has over 40 years of experience at luxury original equipment manufacturers (OEM) across manufacturing, technology and operations and has received over 15 registered patents during his career, Faraday Future said. The Los Angeles-based firm has been grappling with a cash crunch and was roiled by a governance dispute with one of its largest shareholders. Recently, it faced delivery delays with its FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance vehicle. Earlier this month, the company said it had observed a series of ""suspicious activities"", which suggested a ""coordinated effort"" to undermine its valuation. It said it would take legal action if it found any illegal short-selling and other market manipulation or misinformation. Faraday Future's interim CFO had resigned in July. The company said it had uncovered some errors and would restate its financial reports for 2022 and the quarter ended March 2023."
"Americans broadly support auto, Hollywood strikes, Reuters/Ipsos poll shows",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/americans-broadly-support-auto-hollywood-strikes-reutersipsos-poll-2023-09-21/,"WASHINGTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Americans broadly back striking workers in the auto industry and Hollywood, according to a two-day Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Wednesday that found significant support among both Democrats and Republicans. The poll found that 58% of Americans support the first-ever simultaneous strike by the United Auto Workers union against Ford Motor (F.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) to win better pay and benefits, while 32% oppose the action and 10% were unsure. Similarly, 60% of Americans support the dual strikes by screenwriters and actors to win better pay and protections in the entertainment industry, while 27% oppose it and 13% were unsure. The poll found especially strong support among Democrats, who have traditionally allied with labor unions. Some 72% of self-identified Democrats said they backed the auto workers strike and 79% said they supported the Hollywood strike. A large number of Republicans also said they backed the striking workers, even though their party has traditionally advanced pro-business policies and taken a skeptical view of the liberal views espoused by many Hollywood celebrities. The poll found that 48% of Republicans backed the auto workers strike, while 47% opposed it. Similarly, 46% said they supported the Hollywood strikes and 46% said they did not. That divide has been reflected in the battle for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Former President Donald Trump, who leads the field by a wide margin, plans to skip the next candidates' debate on Sept. 27 and instead give a speech to auto workers and other blue-collar union members. Other candidates like Nikki Haley and Tim Scott have said the auto workers are asking for too much. Democratic President Joe Biden, who has sided with the UAW and called on auto companies to concede more to striking workers, has made union outreach a central part of his 2024 reelection bid. He won 57% of union households in the 2020 election, compared with 40% for Trump, according to Edison Research. The poll comes as the United States has seen an uptick in union activism. Through August -- before the UAW strike -- 310,000 U.S. workers were involved in work stoppages, putting 2023 on track to become the busiest year for strikes since 2019. The poll also found broad support for the labor movement in general, even though private-sector union membership remains at historical lows in the United States. Some 61% of respondents said labor unions have improved the quality of life for all Americans, while only 35% said labor unions were no longer necessary. Two-thirds said pay for CEOs and workers should go up equally -- a central talking point of the UAW strike. The online poll of 1,005 U.S. adults was conducted between Sept. 19 and Sept. 20. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, and 6 percentage points for Democratic and Republican responses."
"Lawyers who sued Tesla board for excess pay want $10,000 an hour",https://www.reuters.com/legal/lawyers-who-sued-tesla-board-excess-pay-want-10000-an-hour-2023-09-20/,"WILMINGTON, Delaware, Sept 20 (Reuters) - A legal team that forced Tesla's (TSLA.O) directors to agree in July to return more than $700 million in compensation to the automaker for allegedly overpaying themselves are now seeking a huge payday of their own. The lawyers want a judge to approve $229 million in fees, or $10,690 an hour, according to a Sept. 8 filing in Delaware's Court of Chancery. The proposed fee award, if approved, would be among the largest ever to result from a shareholder lawsuit filed against a board. The sum would be distributed among lawyers from four firms that spent several years building a case against the compensation paid to Tesla's directors from 2017 to 2020. The legal fee and the settlement must be approved by a Delaware judge at a hearing scheduled for October. The 12 director defendants, including James Murdoch and Larry Ellison, agreed to return $735 million in compensation, forego another potential $184 million and overhaul the way the board determines director pay. The money from the settlement will be paid to Tesla and benefits shareholders indirectly, a type of case known as a derivative lawsuit. The law firms estimate the total settlement value at $919 million and are seeking 25% of that as fee. They are also seeking about $1 million in expenses. Partners and other staff from the law firms of Bleichmar Fonti & Auld and Fields Kupka & Shukurov, both of New York, each billed more than 10,000 hours on the case. McCarter & English attorneys and staff in Wilmington, Delaware and Ronald King, a Lansing, Michigan-based attorney with the Clark Hill firm, also billed hundreds of hours. George Bauer of the Bleichmar firm declined to comment and attorneys from the other firms did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Courts review fee requests by examining the need to reward risk-taking and effort while preventing a disproportionate windfall that can undermine confidence in the legal system, said David Paige, the founder of Legal Fee Advisors, a consulting firm. Paige said it was difficult to compare lawyers' bills across different types of contingency-fee cases, but he called the Tesla plaintiffs' request ""extraordinary"" compared to hourly rates that top out around $2,000 for star corporate attorneys. Paige said the court will ultimately have to assess the size of the fee against the benefit of the litigation. The Telsa directors have not objected to the fee request but are expected to do so, according to a court filing by the plaintiffs' lawyers. Attorneys for the directors did not respond to a request for comment. Delaware courts have approved higher hourly rates. In 2012, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed a $304 million fee in a Southern Copper shareholder lawsuit involving $2 billion of damages. The fee worked out to $35,000 an hour, and the defendants opposed it. The state's high court said judges should examine the outcome achieved, not the hourly rate. The Delaware Court of Chancery judge overseeing the Tesla case, Kathaleen McCormick, has scheduled a hearing on Oct. 13 to approve the settlement and the fee. Tesla shareholders have until Friday to file an objection."
"UAW, Detroit Three automakers in standoff as wider strike looms",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/canadian-union-unifor-reaches-tentative-agreement-with-ford-2023-09-20/,"DETROIT, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Detroit's Big Three automakers and the United Auto Workers remained far apart in labor negotiations on Wednesday, less than 48 hours before the union's deadline to make significant progress or escalate a strike with new work stoppages. Talks continued between union representatives and company management on the sixth day of a coordinated walkout, a day after Ford (F.N) averted a strike by Canadian workers. But there were few signs of significant progress, with Detroit automakers increasingly outspoken in rejecting the UAW's demands that include a 40% pay hike, a 32-hour work week and an end to a tiered wage structure that pays newer workers less. ""The fundamental reality is that the UAW's demands can be described in one word — untenable,"" General Motors President Mark Reuss said in an opinion piece published in the Detroit Free Press on Wednesday. ""As the past has clearly shown, nobody wins in a strike. We have delivered a record offer. That is a fact."" The UAW launched a strike against Ford, GM (GM.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI) last week, targeting one U.S. assembly plant at each company. Those strikes have halted production at plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri that produce the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, alongside other popular models. Detroit-based LM Manufacturing, a joint venture between LAN Manufacturing and Magna (MG.TO), said Wednesday it temporarily furloughed 650 workers that produce seats for the Ford Bronco because of the impact of the assembly plant closure. The UAW has said it will announce strikes against more U.S. plants on Friday if no serious progress is made in talks with automakers by 12 p.m. EDT (1600 GMT) on that day. The biggest issues up for negotiation involve the level of pay hikes and benefits for workers. The three automakers have proposed 20% raises over the 4-1/2 year term of their proposed deals, though that is only half of what the UAW is demanding through 2027. UAW workers also want to end a tiered wage structure that they say has created a large gap between newer and older employees, forcing some to work two jobs to make ends meet. Approximately 12,700 workers are on strike as a result of the UAW's coordinated U.S. action, out of the union's 146,000 members who work at the Big Three. ""We're not playing. We're serious about this,"" said Victor Holloway, 24, of Westland, Michigan, who has worked at the striking Ford plant in Wayne, Michigan, since 2021. GM said it was idling its Fairfax, Kansas, car plant on Wednesday because of a shortage of parts as a result of the nearby Missouri strike, a move that will result in 2,000 hourly workers being temporarily furloughed. Analysts expect plants that build more profitable pickup trucks such as Ford's F-150, GM's Chevy Silverado and Stellantis' Ram to be the next strike targets if the walkout continues. Ford reached a last-minute deal to avoid a walkout at its Canadian operations late on Tuesday. Unifor, which represents about 5,600 Canadian auto workers, had been threatening to go on strike at all three Ford's plants in the country if a deal was not reached. The three-year agreement remains subject to ratification by Unifor members, Ford's Canada unit said in a statement, adding that it would not disclose details of the tentative deal. Unifor had sought improved wages and pensions, as well as support in the transition to electric vehicles and additional investment commitments by Ford. The Canadian union will now turn to hammering out deals with GM and Stellantis. Those deadlines were extended while the Ford talks proceeded. Ford said on Tuesday it was making contingency plans for further U.S. work stoppages, including plans to ship parts that keep Ford vehicles on the road, especially to keep first responders and other essential services running. Ford said it continued to negotiate with the UAW, with the focus on reaching a deal that would reward employees and allow the company to invest and grow. Stellantis said on Wednesday it would temporarily lay off 68 employees in Ohio and expected to furlough another 300 workers in Indiana because of the strike at a Jeep assembly plant in Toledo, Ohio. Stellantis anticipates similar actions at Kokomo Transmission and Kokomo Casting in Kokomo, Indiana, impacting an estimated 300 additional employees. A complete walkout by 146,000 UAW auto workers could result in a modest 0.2% drag to annualized growth of U.S. gross domestic product this quarter should the strike action last for a month, RSM estimated. U.S. President Joe Biden wore a red tie on Wednesday in solidarity with UAW workers, the White House said. He has called on automakers to concede more to the striking workers. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told reporters the administration has been very engaged and ""is going to do everything we can to be helpful while respecting the basic fact that this is down to the negotiators."""
Auto strike may spit fuel on US inflation flame,https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/auto-strike-may-spit-fuel-us-inflation-flame-mcgeever-2023-09-20/,"ORLANDO, Florida, Sept 20 (Reuters) - With oil prices at their highest this year and eyeing $100 a barrel again, the last thing U.S. consumers, businesses and policymakers need is another inflationary headache. The fledgling auto workers strike, if it lasts and broadens out, could be just that. Most economists reasonably focus on the temporary blow to U.S. economic output or payrolls from a lengthy strike across the sector. And the economy could contract almost one full percentage point in the fourth quarter, according to Morgan Stanley economists, which would cut their full-year 2023 GDP growth call to 1.4% from 1.7%. But the potential effect on new and used car prices, at a time when inventories remain historically low, combined with a significant wage settlement, could also move the inflation dial. This is a worst-case scenario for the Fed. Policymakers and market participants won't need reminding of the role supply shocks and shortages of chips, parts and other inputs had in driving inflation to the highest in over 40 years after the pandemic. Soaring used car prices had an outsized impact on U.S. inflation, in particular. That dynamic has reversed over the last year, but disinflationary base effects are fading and could quickly flip to being inflationary in the event of a damaging strike. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JP Morgan, is wary. A prolonged nationwide strike could put already-low inventory under heavy strain, posing ""significant"" upside risk to auto prices. ""Such an outcome will present another wrinkle for the ongoing disinflation as it would halt the recent streak of soft readings in the CPI component for motor vehicles,"" he and his team wrote on Friday. STEP ON THE GAS... The transportation group accounts for around 16% of the U.S. Consumer Price Index, and around half of that is the new and used motor vehicles index. The annual rate of used cars and trucks price inflation reached a record high 45% in June 2021, according to one measure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while Cox Automotive's Manheim index of used vehicle prices rose at a peak annual rate of 54% in April that year. Both have been showing annual deflation since late last year, contributing to the slowdown in broader consumer price inflation across the country, but the rate of price declines has been slowing. The United Auto Workers strike against the 'Detroit Three' automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis entered its fifth day on Tuesday. It is the first time ever the union strike has been across all three automakers simultaneously. Fewer than 13,000 of the UAW's 150,000-strong workforce are involved in the strike over pay and benefits, which is currently centered on one U.S. assembly plant at each company. If no agreement is reached, that could quickly spread in numbers and locations. Detroit's Big Three accounted for 43% of new cars sold in the U.S. last year, according to Cox Automotive, so the disruption is potentially huge. JP Morgan analysts also warn that a significant wage settlement - the UAW is looking for a 40% increase over four years - will present an upside risk for inflation across the sector as some of that will be passed onto consumers. Others are more sanguine. Using the 2019 auto workers strike as a proxy, Morgan Stanley's Ellen Zentner and team estimate that higher prices for new vehicles could add 0.02 percentage points to monthly CPI. UBS economists reckon new and used car prices will rise ""marginally"" and that the overall impact on inflation will be ""limited."" Fed officials will hope so. This comes just when the grind higher in oil is starting to bite - crude futures are up 30% in the last three months and for the first time since December the year-on-year price change is positive. That is, oil is once again inflationary, not deflationary. The timing could not be worse. Annual inflation has plummeted this year and by some measures now has, or is close to having, a ""2"" handle - the central bank's 2% goal is within sight. The American public is getting more confident that the inflation scare is over too. The University of Michigan's preliminary five-year consumer inflation expectations index for September fell to 2.7%, the lowest since April 2021 and the one-year outlook fell to 3.1%, the lowest since March 2021.

UAW workers strike at Mercedes supplier ZF's plant in Alabama,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-workers-strike-mercedes-supplier-zfs-plant-alabama-2023-09-20/,"Sept 20 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said on Wednesday that 190 workers went on strike at Mercedes-supplier ZF's plant in Alabama, demanding higher pay and better healthcare benefits. The workers are also seeking an end to the tier system of wages, under which older employees get higher pay than newer workers for the same job. ZF, which makes front axles used by Mercedes, said the plant in Tuscaloosa would operate while talks with the union continue. ""We remain committed to continuing negotiations in good faith and are hopeful that we can come to a resolution soon,"" a ZF spokesperson said in a statement. UAW members are also on a separate strike at three plants operated by the Detroit Three automakers - Ford Motor (F.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI) - demanding better contracts from the companies. Mercedes-Benz said it was monitoring the situation."

Ford reached a last-minute deal to avoid a walkout at its Canadian operations late on Tuesday, as the United Auto Workers union prepared for a potential expansion of its U.S. strikes against the Detroit Three automakers. Unifor, which represents about 5,700 Ford employees in Canada, had sought improved wages and pensions, as well as support in the transition to electric vehicles and additional investment commitments by Ford. Unifor's talks with the Detroit Three automakers in Canada are separate from the UAW's coordinated U.S. action that led to about 12,700 workers going on strike last week against one assembly plant at each of the Detroit Three automakers."

UAW strikes at automakers highlight skyrocketing US CEO pay,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-strikes-automakers-highlight-skyrocketing-us-ceo-pay-2023-09-20/,"WASHINGTON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - When the CEO gets a 40% raise, what do the workers deserve? That question is at the heart of the United Auto Workers union's strikes at assembly plants owned by Ford (F.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI). UAW President Shawn Fain initially asked for a 40% increase in worker's pay over the next four years - a figure based off an approximately 40% increase in CEO pay at the companies over the last four years at a time of stable profits for two of the three automakers. U.S. auto companies are not alone in handing out massive payouts to chief executives. CEO pay and benefits have skyrocketed in recent decades, but worker pay has not kept pace. The ratio of CEO pay to the average, non-supervisory production worker at the biggest U.S. companies has jumped from less than 40 to 1 over the last four decades to nearly 400 to 1, the Economic Policy Institute calculated in 2022. In contrast, some workers for the Big Three automakers who were protesting on the Ohio to Michigan highway this week said they needed to work two jobs to survive. Restructuring the U.S. economy to make things more ""fair"" for workers and voters has been a long-stated goal of President Joe Biden's economic plan. Capitalism is supposed to work ""for the good of the American people,"" Biden has said, but decades of ""trickle down"" tax cuts for companies and the wealthy in the U.S. have undermined the system. As the strikes began last week, Biden echoed Fain, saying automakers should offer more of the share of their profits to workers. But the White House has little leverage besides the bully pulpit and is studying how to stave off the economic impact of a long-term walkout instead. Attempts to address rising CEO pay in decades past have not had the intended effect, said Rosanna Landis Weaver, director of wage justice and CEO pay at As You Sow, a non-profit shareholder advocacy group. Salaries were held down, but compensating top executives through the use of stock options that many considered ""free money"" increased, she said. ""Anytime you tried to squeeze pay in one area it popped out in another - the balloon was never squeezed enough to pop, just enough for the air to go somewhere else."""
"On the Ohio-to-Michigan highway, US auto workers drive for solidarity",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ohio-to-michigan-highway-us-auto-workers-drive-solidarity-2023-09-20/,"TOLEDO, Ohio, Sept 20 (Reuters) - A Toledo grocery store parking lot was full of Jeeps and Fords on Tuesday morning in a show of strength by auto workers on strike from Stellantis's nearby Jeep plant. Dozens set out in an Ohio-to-Michigan convoy to rally support for their walkout, many Jeeps adorned with signs reading ""No Justice, No Jeeps."" ""We don't get no profit sharing. We don't get full benefits. I get paid $16.66 (an hour),"" said Esperanza Ledesma, 32, of Toledo, a temporary employee who has worked at the Jeep plant for a year. ""I make more waitressing. You know what I'm saying? I'm struggling."" The nearly week-old United Auto Workers strike against Ford (F.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI) is viewed as a signal of the strength of the U.S. labor movement that has garnered national support from Americans. The UAW members from two striking plants gathered in Toledo were rolling out for the one-hour, 45-mile (72 km) drive to Wayne, Michigan, where Ford workers also walked off the job last week. UAW workers have numerous demands, including higher pay, with many most concerned about the tiered wage structure that they say has created a yawning gap between newer and older employees. Many work two jobs to make ends meet. Ledesma was hitching a ride in a 2021 Jeep Wrangler for the journey. Her colleague Roxanne Stadtfeld, 58, of Monroe, Michigan, said she earns $19.28 an hour and supplements her income by delivering food for DoorDash. Stadtfeld had her 2019 Dodge Journey for the route, which snakes along the west bank of Lake Erie up into Michigan. Many were traveling in models that these UAW members produce and are among the most profitable vehicles for Ford, GM and Stellantis. They are also the most popular. In Michigan, Ohio and Missouri, the three states where workers are currently striking, models made by the Big Three dominate the leaderboard of new auto registrations. Ford F-Series pickup trucks are on top in all three states, according to S&P Global Mobility data. The United States is still the second-largest car market in the world, trailing only China. U.S. automakers have over the years shifted increasingly to manufacturing heavy pickup trucks and SUVs that have higher margins than smaller vehicles. UAW leaders say they deserve a greater percentage of company profits, while executives fear squeezed margins as a result of higher labor costs and lower-profit electric vehicles. Some 12,700 of the UAW's 150,000 total members who work at the Big Three are on strike, but more could walk off the job in coming weeks if progress is not made. Union membership has fallen steadily over several decades in the United States. However, unions representing workers in the airline, rail, port and retail industries have increasingly been flexing their muscles in recent years as inflation has risen and low unemployment has given labor more power. Picketers at the Toledo plant were joined by other union leaders on Tuesday, including Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, and AFL-CIO head Liz Shuler. ""Nobody has a magic wand. No one can just say, 'Companies act responsibly or fairly with workers.’ That’s why you have this struggle,"" Weingarten said. Among those on the line were Brandon Cappelletty, 25, a temporary employee with Jeep for 4-1/2 years, who works in the paint shop on Gladiator pickups. ""I'm 25 and the pay isn't there, so I can't even move out of my parents' house,"" he said. Cappelletty estimated his net pay in 2022 at about $37,000, working six or seven days on 10-hour shifts on some weeks. He was holding a sign that said ""End Tiers."""
"India's Ola Electric eyes IPO filing by end of October in expedited listing plan, sources say",https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-ola-electric-eyes-ipo-filing-by-end-oct-expedited-listing-plan-sources-2023-09-20/,"MUMBAI, Sept 20 (Reuters) - India's Ola Electric plans to file regulatory papers for its up to $700 million IPO before the end of October as the e-scooter maker fast-tracks its listing move, three people with direct knowledge said. Backed by investors including Singapore's Temasek and Japan's SoftBank (9984.T), Ola Electric was valued at $5.4 billion in a recent fund raising. In an email to its bankers and lawyers on Sunday, an Ola Electric executive asked external advisers on the IPO - including the investment banking units of India's Kotak and ICICI, as well as foreign banks including Bank of America (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs - to give ""utmost priority"" to meet a five-week deadline, said the sources. Ola Electric and Kotak did not respond to a request for comment while the other three banks declined to comment. The sources did not wish to be identified as the communication is internal. Ola's IPO project is internally codenamed ""Project Himalaya"", and the memo came with a request to bankers and lawyers: do not plan any ""long leaves to ensure availability"", said the sources. IPO-bound Indian companies typically do not instruct senior bankers and lawyers to not take leaves, they said. Once the IPO papers are filed, they will be reviewed by India's markets regulator who can also send queries, indicating any possible listing is still some months away. Ola Electric is targeting IPO roadshows for early January or February, said one of the sources. The company, India's market leader in e-scooters with a 30% share, was founded by Bhavish Aggarwal and has seen its popularity surge as the country promotes use of electric cars and scooters. He has said his affordable e-scooters, which start retailing at $1,080, are for the masses, and in an interview this year said ""Tesla is for the West, Ola is for the rest."" Ola Electric, though, still makes losses. It recorded an operating loss of $136 million on revenue of $335 million in the fiscal year ending March 2023, Reuters has reported."
UAW braces for more strikes as deal with automakers remains elusive,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/canadian-union-says-negotiations-with-ford-are-continuing-2023-09-19/,"TOLEDO, Ohio, Sept 19 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers members picketing in Michigan and Ohio urged union leaders to hold firm on their biggest demands on pay hikes and compensation as their first-ever strike against the Detroit Three automakers hit its fifth day. The UAW says it will strike against more U.S. plants on Friday if no serious progress was made in talks with automakers. The UAW launched a strike against Ford (F.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI), last week, targeting one U.S. assembly plant at each company. Workers on the picket lines in Wayne, Michigan, and Toledo, Ohio, on Tuesday said the union should not back down on its demands, with some hoping Friday's deadline for more strikes would produce results. Still, it was not clear when official negotiations between the two sides would resume after lengthy talks on Monday brought little progress, prompting concerns among some auto executives and congressional aides that a deal will not be struck before the Friday noon deadline. ""I’m going to vote no on the contract until they get it right. I know we won’t get everything, but we gave up a lot in 2008 with the recession,"" said Laura Zielinski, 55, who has worked at the Stellantis Jeep plant in Toledo for more than 28 years. ""I’ll do it as long as it takes."" The U.S. strike is now in its fifth day, with some 12,700 of the UAW's 150,000 total members who work at the Big Three on strike. Analysts expect plants that build more profitable pickup trucks like Ford's F-150, GM's Chevy Silverado and Stellantis' Ram would be the next targets if the walkout continues. ""Hopefully they get things resolved within this week,” said Candis Holmes, 35, who works at Ford's Wayne, Michigan, assembly plant, one of three affected by the strike. The union and companies are at loggerheads over pay and benefits for workers. The three automakers have proposed 20% raises over the 4-1/2-year term of their proposed deals, though that is only half of what the UAW is demanding through 2027. Workers have also pushed automakers to eliminate a tiered pay structure that pays newer workers much less for the same jobs than veterans and sought improved cost-of-living adjustments to wages. ""We want them to end tiers because everybody deserves to make a livable wage,"" said Holmes, who has worked at Ford for eight years. The strikes have halted production at plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri that produce the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, alongside other popular models. The White House said on Tuesday that acting Labor Secretary Julie Su and adviser Gene Sperling will continue to speak to all sides from Washington instead of traveling to Detroit. Ford on Friday furloughed 600 workers who are not on strike at the Michigan Bronco plant because of the impact of the work stoppage. GM said it expected to halt operations at its Kansas car plant early this week because of the strike at its nearby Missouri plant, affecting 2,000 workers. Separately, a Canadian union extended its deadline for negotiations at Ford's operations in Canada by one day. Ford's contract with Canadian union Unifor, which represents about 5,600 workers at three plants in Canada, expired at 11:59 p.m. EDT on Monday (0359 GMT on Tuesday). Unifor said early on Tuesday that negotiations had been extended for 24 hours after it received a ""substantive offer"" from Ford but that Unifor members should ""maintain strike readiness."" A walkout by Canadian workers that shuts those engine plants could cripple U.S. production of Ford's most profitable vehicles, even if the UAW decides not to order walkouts at truck plants in Kentucky; Dearborn, Michigan; and Kansas City, Missouri. Ford said it had agreed to continue negotiations beyond the deadline in hopes of reaching a tentative agreement."
"Sidelined on UAW strikes, Biden White House talks economic aid",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/sidelined-uaw-strikes-biden-white-house-talks-economic-aid-2023-09-19/,"WASHINGTON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - As the UAW strike enters its fifth day, the Biden administration is hobbled by a lack of legal authority to steer the talks and difficulty in figuring out UAW President Shawn Fain's negotiating strategy and leadership style, three sources said. The Biden White House is having discussions about ways to blunt any economic fallout from a full walkout in the auto workers strike, the sources said, as U.S. officials acknowledge they have a limited role to play in talks between General Motors, Ford and Chrysler-owner Stellantis and the union. Top administration officials have held multiple calls with union leaders, Michigan lawmakers, company executives, suppliers, outside labor advisers and economists in the run-up to the strike to discuss aid for workers, suppliers and the local state economy, while both parties continue negotiations, one of the sources said. The White House has started an ""inter-agency process"" to study the economic implications of the strike, with a focus on workers, said a fourth source familiar with the matter. The process is triggered by ""all events that could reasonably affect employment and the economy,"" the source said. The White House and the administration have discussed ""mitigation efforts"" in the event of a full work stoppage, not in response to the actions taken by the union currently, two sources said. White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said ""no decision has been made"" on offering aid or measures to lessen the economic impact on affected workers. On Friday, Biden sided clearly with the union, telling automakers to concede more to workers who walked off the job at Detroit's largest car companies and share record profits fairly, and said he would dispatch two of his top officials to Detroit to support both sides in the negotiations. But he was rebuked by UAW's Fain, who said ""this battle is not about the President,"" and the two officials, Gene Sperling, and acting Labor Secretary Julie Su, were not in Detroit as of Monday evening. A White House official said ""their goal is not to intervene or to serve as mediator but to help support the negotiations in any way both parties feel is constructive."" ""Nobody has a read on Fain,"" said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University's School of Industrial & Labor Relations. ""He's not just a stranger to the Biden administration but was a stranger to all of the big three,"" he said, referring to the automakers. Fain has led the UAW for less than six months, and the union has yet to endorse any presidential candidate for 2024. Fain also rejected Republican Donald Trump's entreaties. ""Every fiber of our union is being poured into fighting the billionaire class and an economy that enriches people like Donald Trump at the expense of workers,"" Fain said. Trump said he would go to Detroit to speak on Sept. 27. Top officials such as the Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Joelle Gamble has had calls with auto suppliers recently, the sources said. Aid for suppliers has been thrown around ""since the minute it became clear there could be a strike"" but those talks are ""premature and fluid,"" one of the sources said. The White House believes the biggest 'Tier-1' suppliers will still be able to weather the storm, but smaller companies on the supply chain will struggle if the strike lasts more than six to eight weeks, one of the sources said. The strike could slow an outperforming U.S. economy should it drag on - even risking the first monthly net drop in payroll employment in nearly three years - but is unlikely on its own to trigger a recession, economists say. Pushing original equipment manufacturers to ramp up production and lessen the impact on the country's supply chains has also been discussed by industry on these calls, two sources said. The White House has also been discussing with Michigan lawmakers ways to limit the impact a strike would have on the state's economy, which has suffered from rising transportation costs, wage inflation and COVID-19, the sources added. Among the concerns discussed were job losses and layoffs, a drop in personal income, lower tax revenue for the state, demand for electric vehicles and how wage gains must keep pace with inflation, the sources said. The economic fallout discussions didn't just start. White House chief of staff Jeff Zients had a conversation with the AFL-CIO's executive council at its headquarters in July to discuss ""core labor issues"" and what the administration could do to support workers, one of the sources said. A spokesperson for the AFL-CIO did not comment. Besides Sperling, Su, Gamble and Zients, top White House officials involved in the effort include National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard, Deputy Chief of Staff Jen O'Malley Dillon and Counselor to the President Steve Ricchetti."
Bernie Sanders’s push for four-day weeks has merit,https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/bernie-sanderss-push-four-day-weeks-has-merit-2023-09-19/,"NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders is joining a 100-year-old battle. The United Auto Workers on Friday began strikes at Detroit carmakers Ford Motor (F.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI). Sanders voiced enthusiasm for their biggest demand: moving to a four-day workweek while maintaining five-day pay. Rising productivity has historically enabled labor to win a steady fall in working hours. While the UAW’s proposal is disruptive, revolutions in manufacturing and beyond deserve more gains. UAW members pushed for this policy in the middle of the last century during a prior wave of automation. But since then, workers have been on the losing end of the productivity-versus-wages tradeoff. The industry’s real wages fell 17% from 1990 to 2018, badly lagging the rest of the private sector, while the union says some members are working 80-hour weeks. Now, leading-edge techniques employed by the likes of Tesla (TSLA.O) promise productivity leaps. Ford boss Jim Farley has said that electric vehicles may require 40% fewer worker hours to produce than gas-powered cars. While the auto business might have more at stake now, the global workforce is under threat from automation. With artificial intelligence poised to reshape white-collar jobs, more workers might come to see things Sanders’s way. (By Jonathan Guilford) (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

"From UPS to Detroit Three automakers, US labor unions flex muscle",https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/ups-detroit-three-automakers-us-labor-unions-flex-muscle-2023-09-12/,"Sept 12 (Reuters) - A tight U.S. labor market, expiration of cyclical contracts and high living costs have triggered tough negotiations for pay hikes and other benefits by workers and strikes and protests across industries. Some 309,700 workers have been involved in stoppages through August this year, as per preliminary U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, putting 2023 on track to become the busiest year for strikes since 2019. Some sectors and companies that faced tough negotiations in 2023: Hollywood is experiencing its first dual work stoppage of writers and actors in 63 years, halting productions across the industry and costing the California economy billions of dollars. The strike is over compensation, staffing and residual payments among other issues. The United Auto Workers (UAW) union has launched a targeted strike over pay and benefits against Ford (F.N), GM (GM.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI), targeting one U.S. assembly plant at each company. The union would announce on Friday more U.S. plants to strike if no serious progress was made in talks with the Detroit Three automakers. Teamsters union workers at United Parcel Service (UPS.N) ratified a new five-year contract in August, a deal that raises pay, eliminates a two-tier wage system for drivers, provides another paid holiday and ends forced overtime. FedEx (FDX.N) pilots have been involved in a stand-off with the parcel delivery firm over wages and legacy pensions. Pilots rejected a tentative deal in July and negotiations are expected to restart. Pilots at several airlines including American Airlines (AAL.O), Delta Airlines (DAL.N), United Airlines Holdings (UAL.O), Spirit Airlines (SAVE.N), Jetblue Airways (JBLU.O) negotiated new job contracts this year. Members of some unions like the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association have voted to authorize a strike if a new contract is not reached. Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N) negotiated a new contract to end a strike that led to a week-long work stoppage at its plant in Wichita, Kansas. U.S. steel producer Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (CLF.N) has reached a tentative agreement with the United Steelworkers union on a new three-year labor agreement for its Northshore mining operations. U.S. Steel (X.N), which is reviewing multiple proposals ranging from partial acquisition to an entire buyout, is embroiled in a tussle with the United Steel Workers union. The company's unionized workers say they essentially have the power to veto any transaction they do not approve of. More than 3,000 workers at more than 150 Starbucks (SBUX.O) stores in the U.S. held strikes in June, following claims the company had banned Pride Month decorations at some of its cafes.  read more   read more  Thousands of Los Angeles-area hotel staffers went on a three-day strike in July over improved wages, benefits and working conditions. Union leaders representing the workers have threatened further walkouts. More than 7,000 nurses went on a three-day strike in New York City over staffing levels and pay hikes in January. Unions representing cannabis workers have also increased pressure on companies in the sector this year. Workers at Green Thumb Industries' (GTII.CD) Chicago-area RISE dispensaries went on a 13-day unfair labor practices (ULP) strike in April, which was the longest ULP strike at a cannabis retailer in U.S. history. Labor unions secured new contract agreements at multistate operator-owned cannabis dispensaries in Illinois and in New Jersey in July. Unionized workers at Phillips 66's (PSX.N) refinery in Roxana, Illinois, ratified a contract with the refiner in late-stage negotiations, averting a potential strike. The union had been in talks with the refiner since summer, when it rejected a company proposal and sought additional benefits for holiday and vacation hours and pay, among other improvements."
"Trump to skip next Republican debate, give speech to auto workers",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-skip-next-republican-debate-give-speech-auto-issues-aide-2023-09-18/,"Sept 18 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump plans to give a speech in Detroit on Sept. 27 to a crowd of union workers, skipping the second Republican presidential debate, an aide said on Monday, and instead inserting himself into a dispute between striking workers and America's leading automakers. The prime time speech is expected to be delivered to auto workers and other blue collar union members, the aide added. The speech comes as Trump has been harshly critical of President Joe Biden's electric vehicle policies and urged autoworkers to back his candidacy. The event will mark the second time Trump has skipped a Republican primary presidential debate, in a race where despite his myriad legal problems, Trump leads his nearest rival by nearly 50 percentage points, according to the most recent opinion polls. Trump's speech signals an effort by his team to look beyond his party's White House nominating contest and onto a likely general election re-match with Biden next November. The speech to union members will be part of an intense campaign by Trump to win back some of the working class voters who defected to Biden in his 2020 victory against Trump. The United Auto Workers union began a strike last week against the three biggest U.S. auto manufacturers over pay and other benefits, a labor dispute that could pose significant political danger for Biden. While Biden has touted his support of unions for decades, there is anger among some rank-and-file auto workers that he has not done enough to stand up to the manufacturers and their executives amid huge industry profits. Trump is seeking to exploit the dispute, and will try to persuade auto workers and other union members that he will be on their side if he becomes president again. Biden's campaign on Monday harshly criticized Trump for his policies ahead of the speech. ""Instead of standing with workers, Trump cut taxes for the super-wealthy while auto companies shuttered their doors and shipped American jobs overseas,"" Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement. ""No self-serving photo op can erase Trump's four years of abandoning union workers and standing with his ultra-rich friends."" Trump has said recently that Biden is ""waging war"" on the auto industry through electric vehicle mandates and has said the UAW should endorse him. The current strike also has profound geographical resonance for next year's general election because many of the affected workers are based in three key Midwestern battleground states - Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - where next year's presidential contest could be decided. Trump skipped the first Republican presidential debate in Wisconsin last month. The second debate is being held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute in Simi Valley, California, about 45 miles (72 km) north of Los Angeles."
UAW to strike at more US auto plants if no progress made by Friday,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-detroit-three-automakers-try-reach-deal-before-strike-widens-2023-09-18/,"Sept 18 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said it would announce on Friday more plants to strike if no serious progress was made in talks with Ford, General Motors and Chrysler-parent Stellantis, adding to pressure on the Detroit Three automakers. Ford <F.N> also faces a total strike at its smaller Canadian operations if no agreement is reached on Monday evening with the union representing about 5,600 Canadian auto workers, just days after workers at one of its U.S. plants walked out. The UAW last week launched a targeted strike against Ford, GM (GM.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI), targeting one U.S. assembly plant at each company. ""We're not going to keep waiting around forever while they drag this out,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a video message late on Monday setting the new deadline after complaining about a lack of progress in recent talks. ""We're not messing around."" Canadian union Unifor, whose contract with Ford expires at 11:59 EDT on Monday (0359 GMT on Tuesday), said there was still no deal just hours before the deadline. Unifor National President Lana Payne said in a video posted on the union's website that Ford needed to do more to meet members' expectations and demands. ""If there is a strike, this will be a total strike,"" she said. ""Every single one of Unifor's 5,600 members at Ford in Canada will be on picket lines."" Ford has two engine plants in Canada that build V-8 motors for F-series and Super Duty pickups assembled in the United States. It also has an assembly plant in Ontario. A walkout by Canadian workers that shut down those engine plants could cripple U.S. production of Ford's most profitable vehicles, even if the UAW decides not to order walkouts at truck plants in Kentucky; Dearborn, Michigan; and Kansas City, Missouri. ""Ours is a small but highly consequential footprint for Ford operations in North America and this is our leverage, and we will use it,"" Payne said. Talks between the UAW and the Detroit automakers continued on Monday as a strike by auto workers over pay dragged on for a fourth day with little sign of progress toward a deal. Some 12,700 workers are striking at the three U.S. plants, including 3,300 at Ford's Wayne, Michigan assembly plant. Union negotiators and representatives of GM, Ford and Stellantis held talks over the weekend in an attempt to end one of the most ambitious U.S. industrial labor actions in decades. On Monday, the UAW held talks with Stellantis though no deal was reached. It had scheduled a new round of talks with Ford for late afternoon. Fain told NPR on Monday there were ""minimal conversations over the weekend so the ball is in their court .... We have a long way to go."" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said it was premature to forecast the strike's impact on the economy, which would depend on how long the action lasted and what was affected. The strikes have halted production at plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri that produce the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, alongside other popular models. Ford on Friday furloughed 600 workers who are not on strike at the Michigan Bronco plant because of the impact of the work stoppage. GM said it expected to halt operations at its Kansas car plant early this week because of the strike at its nearby Missouri plant, affecting 2,000 workers. Analysts expect plants that build more profitable pickup trucks like Ford's F-150, GM's Chevy Silverado and Stellantis's Ram to be the next strike targets if the walkout continues. The union and companies are at loggerheads over pay and benefits for workers. The three automakers have proposed 20% raises over the 4-1/2-year term of their proposed deals, though that is only half of what the UAW is demanding through 2027. The UAW at one point during the talks offered to lower its demand to 36%. Besides higher wages, the UAW is also demanding shorter work weeks, restoration of defined benefit pensions and stronger job security as automakers make the shift to electric vehicles. Separately, former President Donald Trump plans to skip the second Republican presidential debate and make a speech in Detroit on Sept. 27 to autoworkers and others discussing vehicle issues, an aide said."
Indian e-scooter maker Ather readies new models and exports after subsidy cuts,https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-e-scooter-maker-ather-readies-new-models-exports-after-subsidy-cuts-2023-09-18/,"BENGALURU, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Indian electric scooter maker Ather Energy will accelerate new model launches at home and test export markets, its chief executive told Reuters, raising new money to boost growth after the government lowered subsidies for the vehicles. India's electric scooter market is small but growing, with e-models accounting for 5% of total scooter and motorcycle sales in the last fiscal year against a government target of 70% by 2030. But in a surprise move in May, the government, without explanation, slashed cash incentives on the vehicles to a maximum of 15% of the price before taxes from 40% earlier. The next month total e-scooter sales more than halved. Ather's sales also dropped but are rapidly picking up. CEO Tarun Mehta said in an interview that the company is now working on two new models, one of which will be launched six months earlier than originally planned. ""The transition to electric vehicles could have been faster if not for the (subsidy) change but even then, there will be no major impact in the mid to long term,"" he said. ""This shift means we are having to fast track product launches and invest more in product development,"" he added. As part of a long-term growth strategy, Ather is aiming for more than 50% of its sales to come from global markets by the end of the decade, Mehta said. Ather, India's third-largest e-scooter maker after Softbank Group-backed (9984.T) Ola Electric and local TVS Motor (TVSM.NS), plans to add a scooter designed for use by different members of a family to its current two-model lineup aimed at individual riders, Mehta said. Valued at around $750 million, Ather will raise more money before the end of 2023 to back its growth plans, he said, without giving more details. A source with direct knowledge of Ather's plans said the company is looking to raise an amount similar to the $108 million garnered from existing shareholders Hero MotoCorp (HROM.NS) and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC in a recent rights issue. Ather will also pilot sales in one Asian export market in a couple of months. ""India will not only be the largest market in the world for electric two-wheelers but also the largest exporter,"" he said."
What are Republican U.S. presidential candidates saying about the UAW strike?,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/some-republican-2024-presidential-candidates-reaction-uaw-strike-2023-09-18/,"Sept 18 (Reuters) - Labor negotiations continued this week between union negotiators and representatives of the Detroit Three automakers days into a strike against General Motors (GM.N), Ford (F.N) Below are comments from some of the 10 Republican presidential candidates seeking their party's 2024 nomination to take on Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden, who has backed the United Auto Workers. The former U.S. president, in a post on his social media website on Sunday: ""The United Autoworkers are being sold down the ""drain"" with this all Electric Car SCAM. They'll be made in China, under Crooked Joe's CHINA FIRST POLICY. AUTOWORKERS, VOTE FOR TRUMP - I'LL MAKE YOU VICTORIOUS & RICH. IF YOUR ""LEADERS"" WON'T ENDORSE ME, VOTE THEM OUT OF OFFICE, NOW. WITH THE DEMOCRATS & CROOKED JOE CALLING THE SHOTS, YOU'LL BE JOBLESS & PENNILESS WITHIN 4 YEARS. REMEMBER, BIDEN IS A CROOK WHO HAS BEEN PAID MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BY CHINA, & OTHERS. He is a Manchurian Candidate!!!"" On Friday, he wrote: ""The all Electric Car is a disaster for both the United Auto Workers and the American Consumer. They will all be built in China and, they are too expensive, don't go far enough, take too long to charge, and pose various dangers under certain atmospheric conditions. If this happens, the United Auto workers will be wiped out, along with all other auto workers in the United States. The all Electric Car policy is about as dumb as Open Borders and No Voter I.D. IT IS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISASTER!"" The former vice president under Trump told CNN on Sunday, when asked about the ""general fairness"" of higher CEO pay compared to their workers' salaries: ""That ought to be left to the shareholders of that company. I'm somebody that believes in free enterprise. I think those are decisions that can be made by shareholders and creating pressure. And I will fully support how these publicly traded companies operate. I'm not interested in government mandates or government bullying when it comes to those kind of issues."" ""I side with American workers. I side with all American families. I side with the people of this country, Jake, that are living under the failed policies of the Biden administration. Families are struggling. Families are hurting. They know we need new leadership in the White House,"" Pence added when asked if he sided with CEOS or the union. The former biotechnology investor and executive said ahead of campaign remarks in Washington on Friday, according to video posted by local media: ""I empathize with workers who have seen wages not go up nearly at the same rate as prices have gone up. ... The people they should be really protesting against is the current administration that has given us the economic policies of inflation without wage growth to go along with it. ... So I understand the frustration, but I think union bosses may be directing that ire in the wrong direction when it belongs at the feet of our current government."" The former South Carolina governor and ambassador to the United Nations under Trump told Fox News in an interview on Saturday: ""It tells you when you have the most pro-union president and he touts that he is emboldening the unions, this is what you get. And I'll tell you who pays for it is the taxpayers. ... The union is asking for a 40% raise, the companies have come back with a 20% raise - I think any of the taxpayers would love to have a 20% raise and think that's great. But the problem is we're all going to suffer from this. This is going to cause things to go up, and this is going to last awhile ... I don't think government should get involved in this. These are private sector matters. But I do think the tone of how a president talks about unions and how a president emboldens them does play a role in this, and we're seeing what Biden has done."" As governor, ""I was a union buster. I didn't want to bring in companies that were unionized simply because I didn't want to have that change the environment in our state. We very much watched out for workers. ... We didn't encourage middlemen between companies and their workers. We encouraged workers to have that direct communication with them,"" Haley added. The U.S. senator from South Carolina said at an event in South Carolina on Friday, according to local media: ""We're watching today, on every screen around the country, we're seeing the UAW fight for more benefits and less hours working. More pay and fewer days on the job. It's a disconnect from work."" North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum said he was not surprised, when asked about the strike in New Hampshire on Monday: ""This is not just about wages. This is about a battle about the future of American transportation. And the union workers are going 'wow, if we're going to switch to all EVs, we're going to have less jobs ..., we're going to be dependent on China for our transportation needs.' ... They understand what's happening. And the federal government to play a role in an industry debate where they're basically saying we're going to subsidize this kind of vehicle - a vehicle with an EV engine, we're gonna subsidize it, and if it's got an internal combustion machine, we're not subsidizing it - to be that specific, America should be outraged, because it's like, what are we just going to get rid of free markets, what we built this country on?"""
Hyundai Motor's South Korea union accepts 12% wage hike deal,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/hyundai-motors-south-korea-union-approves-wage-deal-union-official-2023-09-18/,"SEOUL, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and a union representing its South Korean workforce on Monday sealed a wage deal that will boost annual pay by about 12%, avoiding a strike and production losses at the company's biggest manufacturing base. The union, one of the biggest in South Korea with more than 44,000 members, said on Monday that a total of 58.8% of its voting members had approved the tentative agreement reached last week, while 41.1% rejected it. Unionised workers voted last month for a possible strike over demands for higher wages, a performance bonus and an increase in the mandatory retirement age to 64 from 60. The union demand to increase the retirement age - which would have allowed workers to stay in their jobs, reducing reliance on the pension system, for longer - was not accepted. Workers at Hyundai Motor, the No.3 global automaker by sales with its affiliate Kia Corp (000270.KS), last went on strike in 2018. Unionised workers at Hyundai in South Korea held a four-hour strike for one day in July in support of a general strike, but it was not related to the union's wage negotiations with the management. The United Auto Workers (UAW) last week went on strike against all three Detroit automakers - General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI) - at once for the first time. Hyundai Motor Group, which houses Hyundai Motor, Kia, luxury brand Genesis, operates U.S. production sites in Alabama and Georgia. The auto group currently is building electric vehicle and battery plant in Georgia. “The labour risks have been there all along, especially in the auto sector, but this UAW strike is unprecedented. If the UAW manages to win major pay raises, it could make workers at foreign automakers, like Hyundai Motor and Kia, that operate non-union plants in the United States, think about the UAW representation,” said Lee Jae-il, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities."
"UAW strike against automakers enters third day, no resolution seen",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-auto-workers-strike-against-detroit-three-enters-third-day-2023-09-17/,"Sept 17 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers strike against the Detroit Three automakers entered its third day on Sunday with no immediate resolution on the horizon. Union negotiators and representatives of General Motors (GM.N), Ford (F.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI) were set to resume talks starting Sunday, following the start of the most ambitious U.S. industrial labor action in decades. This is the first time the UAW has gone on strike against all three automakers simultaneously. The coordinated strike comes at a time when Americans' approval of labor unions is at its highest point in decades even as membership in unions remains largely unchanged. UAW President Shawn Fain told MSNBC on Sunday that progress in the talks has been slow. The UAW resumed talks with GM on Sunday, and will do so with Stellantis and Ford on Monday. “I don't really want to say we're closer,” he said. “It's a shame that the companies didn't take our advice and get down to business from the beginning of bargaining back in mid-July.” Asked in a subsequent appearance on CBS Face the Nation whether workers would walk out at more plants this week, Fain said the union was ""prepared to do whatever we have to do."" About 12,700 UAW workers remain on strike as part of a coordinated labor action targeting three U.S. assembly plants - one at each of the Detroit Three automakers after the prior four-year labor agreements expired at 11:59 p.m. ET on Thursday. Negotiators for the UAW and Ford had ""reasonably productive discussions"" toward a new contract on Saturday, the union said, while Chrysler-parent Stellantis said it hiked its offer, proposing raises of 20% over a four-and-a-half-year contract term, including an immediate 10% hike. That matched proposals from GM and Ford. The proposals are about half the 40% wage hike the UAW is demanding through 2027, including an immediate 20% boost. U.S. President Joe Biden, who has signaled support for the union's efforts, has had acting Labor Secretary Julie Su and advisor Gene Sperling speaking to the UAW and the automakers during the talks. An administration official said on Sunday that Biden believes new agreements with the automakers should ensure that auto jobs going forward are good middle class jobs. Mark Stewart, the North American chief operating officer for Stellantis, told reporters Saturday the UAW rejected a proposal to resume operations at an assembly plant in Belvidere, Illinois, noting its offer had been contingent on reaching agreement before the contract expiration. In late February, Stellantis indefinitely idled operations at the Belvidere plant, citing rising costs of electric vehicle production. The UAW criticized the company position on the Illinois plant saying now ""they are now taking it back. That’s how they see these workers. A bargaining chip."" Stellantis said late Saturday it is willing to negotiate about the plant's future. ""The truth is UAW leadership ignored Belvidere in favor of a strike,"" the company said. The strikes have halted production at three plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri that produce the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, along with other popular models. GM has been struggling to launch its new EVs and a prolonged UAW strike could hurt those efforts even if it has a chance of helping in the short term, analysts said. Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally said in a Sunday research note he expects plants that build more profitable pickup trucks like Ford's F-150, GM's Chevrolet Silverado and Stellantis' Ram to be the next strike targets if the walkout continues. On Friday, Ford said it was indefinitely laying off 600 workers at a Michigan plant because of the impact of the strike at the facility, which makes the Bronco, and GM told some 2,000 workers at a Kansas car plant that their factory likely would be shut down Monday or Tuesday due to a lack of parts stemming from the strike at a GM Missouri plant. Besides higher wages, the UAW is demanding shorter work weeks, restoration of defined benefit pensions and stronger job security as automakers make the EV shift."
UAW cites 'productive' talks with Ford on second day of US auto strike,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-automakers-resume-labor-talks-stellantis-hikes-wage-offer-2023-09-16/,"Sept 16 (Reuters) - Negotiators for the United Auto Workers and Ford Motor had ""reasonably productive discussions"" toward a new contract, the union said on Saturday, while officials at Chrysler parent Stellantis said a proposal to resume work at an idled Illinois factory has fallen through. About 12,700 UAW workers remained on strike for a second day as part of a coordinated labor action targeting three U.S. assembly plants - one at each of the Detroit Three automakers. Union negotiators and representatives of General Motors (GM.N), Ford (F.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI) resumed talks on Saturday, a day after the UAW initiated the most ambitious U.S. industrial labor action in decades. There was no sign of a breakthrough as of Saturday afternoon. However, the UAW comment about the tenor of talks at Ford was more positive than the union's characterization of progress ahead of the kickoff of the strikes. On Thursday, Ford CEO Jim Farley said the UAW's proposals would push the company to bankruptcy, adding that there was ""nothing going on"" in negotiations. ""As we have said all along, Ford has bet on the UAW more than any other company. We are committed to reaching an agreement with UAW that rewards our workers and allows Ford to invest in the future. We have to win together,"" Mark Truby, Ford's chief communications officer, said in a statement. Stellantis said on Saturday it had hiked its offer, proposing raises of 20% over a four-and-a-half-year contract term, including an immediate 10% hike. That matches proposals from GM and Ford. Stellantis said talks would resume on Monday. The automakers said the proposals work out to a cumulative 21% hike over the period, but they are still significantly below the 40% wage hike the UAW is demanding through 2027. The union's wage demand includes a 20% immediate increase. Mark Stewart, the North American chief operating officer for Stellantis, told reporters on Saturday the UAW rejected a proposal to resume operations at an assembly plant in Belvidere, Illinois, noting that the company's offer had been contingent on reaching agreement before the contract expiration. In late February, Stellantis indefinitely idled operations the Belvidere plant, citing rising costs of electric vehicle production. The UAW criticized the company position on the Illinois plant saying now ""they are now taking it back. That’s how they see these workers. A bargaining chip."" Stewart declined to offer specific details, but added that Stellantis was still willing to talk about the facility's future. He described the company's latest overall contract offer as ""very compelling."" Stellantis also said it is offering more than $1 billion in retirement security improvements and other increases in benefits. ""This is not about greed,"" he said, ""This is about sharing success."" The strikes have halted production at three plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri that produce the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, along with other popular models. Automakers have said they need cost-competitive contracts because the multi-billion dollar transition to electric vehicles (EV), while workers note U.S. automakers have enjoyed robust profits over the last decade and had hiked CEO salaries by 40% on average since 2019. On Friday, Ford said it was indefinitely laying off 600 workers at a Michigan plant because of the impact of the strike at the facility, which makes the Bronco SUV, and GM (GM.N) told some 2,000 workers at a Kansas car plant that their factory likely would be shut down next week for lack of parts, stemming from a strike at a Missouri plant. Stellantis said on Saturday it does not anticipate any other plants being disrupted by the strike at its Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio. UAW President Shawn Fain called the reports of planned layoffs of non-striking workers an attempt by the automakers to ""squeeze"" union members into accepting a weaker settlement. ""Their plan won't work,"" Fain said in a statement. ""We'll organize one day longer than they can, and go the distance to win economic and social justice at the Big Three."" Besides higher wages, the UAW is demanding shorter work weeks, restoration of defined benefit pensions and stronger job security as automakers make the EV shift. The union also wants an end to so-called ""two-tier"" wages, while automakers have proposed cutting the number of years needed to reach top pay levels from eight to four years. The UAW said the automakers have rejected many key demands. The automakers have said the UAW demands could hike the current mid-$60-per-hour labor cost to more than $150 an hour. GM said on Thursday the UAW wage and benefits proposals would cost it $100 billion, while Ford's Farley said a 40% UAW wage hike would ""put us out of business."" U.S. President Joe Biden, who faces re-election next year, called on Friday for the auto companies to reward workers just as executives' salaries have risen. ""The companies have made some significant offers, but I believe they should go further to ensure record corporate profits mean record contracts,"" he said."
Explainer: UAW strikes target Detroit Three automakers: An explainer,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/auto-industry-tenterhooks-uaw-kicks-off-talks-with-detroit-three-2023-07-12/,"Sept 16 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union on Friday launched strikes at three U.S. auto plants after failing to reach an agreement over new contracts, the first-ever simultaneous labor action against the Detroit Three automakers. The UAW contracts at General Motors (GM.N), Ford Motor (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) expired at 11:59 p.m. EDT on Thursday. Detroit automakers, like their global counterparts, have been focused on cost reductions, which in some cases include job cuts, to help accelerate a shift to electric vehicles (EVs) from gasoline-powered vehicles. The UAW, which represents 46,000 GM workers, 57,000 Ford employees and 43,000 Stellantis workers, kicked off negotiations with the companies in July. The union historically has picked one of the Detroit Three to negotiate with first as the so-called target that sets the pattern on which subsequent deals are based. This time, UAW President Shawn Fain targeted all three companies simultaneously. Contract talks between the UAW and the Detroit automakers in past years had gone on until the strike deadline and beyond. Stellantis said on Saturday it has hiked its wage offer, proposing raises of 20% over a four-and-a-half-year contract term, including an immediate 10% hike. That matches proposals from GM and Ford. The automakers say the proposals work out to a cumulative 21% hike over the period. The union previously has rejected the companies' offers. It has demanded a 40% wage hike, including a 20% immediate increase, and improvements in benefits. ""We'll organize one day longer than they can and go the distance to win economic and social justice at the Big Three,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said on Saturday. The UAW is pushing automakers to eliminate the two-tier wage system under which new hires earn as much as 25% less than veterans. Fain has said repeatedly that the union will push to restore pay improvements tied to the cost of living and retiree benefits cut during the 2008-2009 economic crisis. The UAW also wants strong salary increases, given the financial success of the automakers, citing generous executive payouts and large U.S. federal subsidies for EV sales. The union also wants defined benefit pensions for all workers restored, 32-hour work weeks and additional cost-of-living hikes, job security guarantees and an end to the use of temporary workers. Fain also is aiming to get agreements that would allow the UAW to represent hourly workers at joint-venture EV battery plants opened or planned by the Detroit Three. The UAW has been wary of the industry shift to EVs and called on the Biden administration to soften its proposed vehicle emission cuts that would require 67% of new vehicles to be electric by 2032. EVs require fewer parts to build, and industry officials have said that will result in a need for fewer workers. Fain has said there should be no jobs lost because of the EV shift. The Detroit Three want to close the cost gap they have with foreign automakers with non-unionized U.S. factories. Ford sources estimate that their U.S. labor costs are $64 an hour, compared with an estimated $55 for foreign automakers and $45 to $50 for EV leader Tesla (TSLA.O). The companies also want greater flexibility in how they use their U.S. workforces to increase efficiency and cut costs as the industry shifts to EVs. The industrial action hit the Detroit Three automakers as they ramp up efforts to maximize gasoline and EV vehicle production to capitalize on demand for new vehicles. A full strike would hit earnings at each affected automaker by about $400 million to $500 million per week assuming all production was lost, Deutsche Bank previously estimated. Some losses could be recouped by boosting production schedules later, but that possibility fades if a strike extends to weeks or months. In fiscal 2019, GM's fourth-quarter profit took a $3.6 billion hit from a 40-day UAW strike. A broad strike could also trickle down and squeeze quarterly profits for auto part suppliers such as Aptiv (APTV.N), Lear Corp (LEA.N) and Magna (MG.TO). A 10-day strike by the UAW could cost manufacturers, workers, suppliers and dealers more than $5 billion, according to an analysis by the Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm. The walkout on Friday was smaller than some analysts expected, with only three auto plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri targeted. Those plants produce the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, along with other popular models."
"UAW says Stellantis boosts wage-hike offer to 19.5%, Detroit News reports",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-boosts-wage-hike-offer-195-seeks-concessions-uaw-says-detroit-news-2023-09-16/,"Sept 15 (Reuters) - Stellantis' (STLAM.MI) latest offer to the striking United Auto Workers includes raising wages 19.5% and making salaried workers hourly, the Detroit News reported on Friday, citing the union. The offer from Chrysler's parent company includes consolidating after-sales parts plants and increasing the number of supplemental workers the Jeep maker can use, the report said. UAW President Shawn Fain said on Wednesday that Stellantis had proposed a 17.5% pay hike. Union Vice President Rich Boyer criticized the proposal at a Friday rally in Detroit as ""concessionary"" and the result of concerns over the electrification transition, the report added. The first simultaneous strike against the Detroit Three automakers, launched on Friday, has halted production at three plants, producing the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, along with other popular models. The union, which represents 146,000 U.S. auto workers, has been asking for 40% pay raises through September 2027 and major improvements in benefits as part of what it calls ""audacious"" demands."
"UAW, automakers to resume talks as strike starts to create parts shortage",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-auto-union-strike-three-detroit-three-factories-2023-09-15/,"DETROIT, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers said it plans to resume bargaining on Saturday after launching its first simultaneous strikes at General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis, with effects of the limited shutdown starting to spread on Friday. The most ambitious U.S. industrial labor action in decades has halted production at three plants producing the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, along with other popular models. By Friday afternoon a ripple effect was felt. ""Our production system is highly interconnected, which means the UAW’s targeted strike strategy will have knock-on effects for facilities that are not directly targeted for a work stoppage,"" Ford (F.N) said in a statement. It told 600 workers who are not striking not come to work on Friday and GM (GM.N) told some 2,000 workers at a Kansas car plant that their factory likely would be shut down next week for lack of parts, stemming from a nearby plant being struck. At a rally on Friday afternoon and at picket lines during the day, union members protested loudly and took special aim at a two-tiered wage system that left new hires without the pay or benefits of seasoned hands. That was unfair and favored investors over workers, they said. ""We’re not going to wreck the economy. The truth is we are going to wreck the billionaire economy,"" said UAW President Shawn Fain. The union is demanding a bigger share of profits, shorter work weeks, restoration of defined benefit pensions and stronger job security as automakers shift to electric vehicles. UAW vice president Chuck Browning, who is leading talks with Ford, told a rally of hundreds of UAW workers in downtown Detroit on Friday afternoon that recent talks have made ""good progress, but we have far to go."" U.S. President Joe Biden, who faces re-election next year, called for the auto companies to reward workers just as executives' salaries have risen. ""The companies have made some significant offers but I believe they should go further to ensure record corporate profits mean record contracts,"" he said. Striking workers said ""tier two"" employees can make only half the hourly wages of senior UAW workers and get worse benefits. ""That's the biggest thing I hear in our plant: we were built on equal pay for equal work,"" said Bruce Baumhower, the UAW president for the local including the striking Stellantis (STLAM.MI), Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio. Some two-tier systems were set in place during bankruptcies more than a decade ago. The starting wage for tier two workers of $15.78 now is on par with fast food restaurants and has not changed since it was set 14 years ago, he said. ""Fourteen years later, our workers are still in bankruptcy,"" he added. None of the Detroit Three has proposed eliminating those tiered wage systems, a key UAW demand, but they have offered to cut the time needed to reach top pay to four from eight years. ""I think they are making progress at the table,"" said Arthur Wheaton, who teaches collective bargaining at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor relations. Automakers have raised wage offers and the UAW appears to be focusing its demands. ""You're no longer hearing anything about the 32-hours work week from the UAW,"" he said. Executives say the union's asks would make the automakers uncompetitive against other nonunion rivals. Ford CEO Jim Farley said the UAW's 40% wage hike demand would ""put us out of business."" GM CEO Mary Barra on ""CBS This Morning"" on Friday said ""We still have a ways to go with the offer they put on the table last night."" Senator Bernie Sanders, speaking at the Friday rally, retorted, “I say to Ms. Barra, do you have any idea what it’s like for one of your workers to survive on $17 an hour?” Friday's walkout was smaller than some analysts expected. ""Keep the other plants open,"" said Sofus Nielsen, a 29-year Ford veteran, outside the Wayne plant. ""This way we can be out here longer and hurt them more.” The UAW has an $825 million strike fund but the automakers have built up billions thanks to robust profits from trucks and SUVs. Biden on Friday said acting Labor Secretary Julie Su and adviser Gene Sperling will travel to Detroit to offer support for talks but the White House said they would not mediate. Ford shares ended barely changed on Friday, GM stock rose about 1% and Stellantis shares earlier closed up 1.9% in Milan. The automakers have offered up to 20% wage hikes, without key benefits demanded by the union. Ford said the UAW's latest proposals would double its U.S. labor costs and make it uncompetitive against Tesla (TSLA.O) and other nonunion rivals. Stellantis said it had immediately gone into ""contingency mode"" and would take structural decisions to protect the company and its North American operations, without elaborating. Nearly half the 12,700 striking workers are at the Stellantis plant, although management has been preparing: a parking lot of finished Jeeps is more than a mile long outside the factory. GM said on Thursday the UAW wage and benefits proposals would cost the automaker $100 billion, but did not elaborate. Fain has rejected the automakers' assertions, saying the companies have spent billions on share buybacks and executive salaries. While Biden is pouring billions in federal subsidies into expanding electric-vehicle sales, this shift could threaten combustion powertrain jobs. The UAW has not endorsed his re-election. Biden's likely opponent, former president Donald Trump, on Friday criticized the shift to EVs as a job-killer for the UAW."
Detroit Three plants where UAW is on strike,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/detroit-three-plants-where-uaw-plans-strike-2023-09-15/,"Sept 15 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union began unprecedented, simultaneous walkouts at General Motors (GM.N), Ford (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis' (STLAM.MI) U.S. operations early on Friday after failing to reach pay deals with the automakers. The walkouts cap weeks of clashes between the union and Detroit Three executives over union demands for a bigger share of profits generated by combustion trucks, and stronger job security as automakers shift to electric vehicles. These are the first plants where strikes are taking place: Wentzville, Missouri assembly plant About 3,600 UAW members Products produced: Chevrolet Colorado and Express; GMC Canyon and Savanna FORD Wayne, Michigan assembly plant, excluding stamping plant About 3,300 UAW members Products produced: Ford Ranger and Bronco STELLANTIS Toledo, Ohio assembly plant About 5,800 UAW members Products produced: Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator"
Biden wants automakers to give UAW workers more in strike talks,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-address-us-auto-negotiations-friday-white-house-2023-09-15/,"WASHINGTON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday called on automakers to concede more to workers who walked off the job at Detroit's largest car companies, accusing them of enjoying record profits without sharing them fairly with workers. The UAW strike at three factories owned by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler-owner Stellantis kicked off the most ambitious U.S. industrial labor action in decades. ""No one wants a strike, but I respect workers' right to use their options under the collective bargaining"" system, Biden said. ""I understand their frustration."" The auto companies have made some significant offers in negotiations so far, Biden said. ""But I believe they should go further to ensure record corporate profits mean record contracts for the UAW,"" he said, echoing sentiments by union leaders. Labor unions like the UAW - which represents 146,000 workers - are key to Biden's game plan for winning reelection in 2024. He needs their support to win key states like Pennsylvania and Michigan again, which stand to bear the brunt of any major strikes against carmakers. The UAW has yet to endorse Biden, the only major union not to do so. A prolonged strike could be a drag on a U.S. economy that has been performing better than expected, but is unlikely to lead to a recession, analysts say. Biden said he would dispatch two members of his team, Gene Sperling and Labor Secretary Julie Su, to Detroit to ensure the administration is involved in talks and a ""win-win agreement."" Biden, who had predicted over the Labor Day weekend that the union would not strike, spoke to union and automaker leaders on Thursday. The Biden administration is also discussing emergency aid to protect smaller firms that supply U.S. auto manufacturers, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. Former U.S. President Trump, who is the leading Republican challenger for Biden's 2024 re-election bid, criticized Biden's push for electric vehicles on social media as a ""total disaster"" and attacked UAW leaders in an interview to be aired Sunday. ""The auto workers are being sold down the river by their leadership,"" Trump said in the interview with NBC's Meet the Press. Under Trump, auto companies ""would likely have gone bankrupt,"" the Biden campaign said in a statement. ""Trump will say literally anything to distract from his long record of breaking promises and failing America's workers."" The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, one of the largest business lobby groups, blamed Biden on Friday for the strikes, and said they would result in higher costs for workers not in a union and lost profits for other businesses. ""The UAW strike and indeed 'the summer of strikes' is the natural result of the Biden administration's whole of government approach to promoting unionization at all costs,"" said Suzanne Clark, the group's chief executive, urging both groups to return to the bargaining table and end the strike. Biden, 80, is tying his 2024 re-election bid to the health of the economy, highlighting job growth, rising wages and fading recession fears, which a prolonged strike could threaten."
GM expects to be forced to idle Kansas auto plant next week,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-expects-be-forced-idle-kansas-auto-plant-next-week-2023-09-15/,"Sept 15 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM.N) said on Friday it expects to be forced to idle operations at its Kansas assembly plant next week after the United Auto Workers union struck a nearby Missouri plant earlier in the day - the first ripple effect from the walkout. The Detroit automaker said the Wentzville, Missouri, plant, where workers went on strike, is providing critical stampings to its Fairfax, Kansas, assembly plant. ""Due to the strike’s impact on Wentzville operations, we anticipate running out of parts for Fairfax as soon as early next week. The parts situation is fluid, and we are actively managing the situation,"" GM said. ""Since Fairfax won't be able to run production due to a part shortage caused by the strike in Wentzville, there is no work available."""
UAW Chief Shawn Fain disrupts Detroit's labor tradition,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-chief-shawn-fain-disrupts-detroits-labor-tradition-2023-09-15/,"Sept 15 (Reuters) - He is known to quote the Bible and Nation of Islam civil rights leader Malcolm X. He is a social media fanatic who keeps the pay stubs of his union member grandfather in his wallet. And now, Shawn Fain is representing nearly 150,000 auto workers in one of the biggest labor strikes in decades. In taking action against all three Detroit carmakers, Fain, the head of the United Auto Workers, has remade the strategy of the union he leads, choosing a bolder, much riskier path than his predecessors after he won office by a narrow margin in a first-ever direct election earlier this year. The strike started as the clock hit midnight on Friday, and followed Fain's decision to open negotiations with Ford Motor (F.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI) simultaneously and eschew public niceties involving choreographed handshakes that famously kicked off previous negotiating efforts. The strategy is not without risk. A weeks-long strike would hit workers who live paycheck to paycheck, while the Detroit Three automakers have billions in cash to withstand the walkout. Fain, 54, has made creative use of social media, appearances on network and cable news programs and alliances with high-profile progressive politicians such as U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, to reframe the UAW's contract bargaining as a battle to re-set the balance of power between workers and global corporations. He has rebutted automakers' concerns about labor costs by pointing out that they have poured billions into share buybacks to benefit investors. ""If they’ve got money for Wall Street they sure as hell have money for the workers making the product,"" he said. “We fight for the good of the entire working class and the poor."" In lengthy social media talks to UAW members, Fain alternates quoting Bible verses with the use of charts and graphs to dissect wage and benefit offers from the automakers - details his predecessors kept behind closed doors during bargaining crunch time. Fain, in his unorthodox approach, ran what amounted to a public auction among the companies to push each one to top the other to avoid a costly walkout. Prior UAW presidents picked just one automaker to set a pattern for the other two. Over and over, Fain has told UAW members at the Detroit Three that they can reverse 20 years of wage and retiree benefit concessions, stop further plant closures and end a seniority-based, tiered compensation system that pays new hires as much as 44% less than veteran workers. ""He's basically showing me who he is and where he comes from every time he presents himself. So, when he shows the plan, I can follow it. I understand that it’s a new way of going about things and I think he’s really shaking them up,” said Darwin Segers, 49, a UAW member who works at the Stellantis Mack Plant in Detroit. Achieving any one of those goals in one bargaining round would be a significant achievement. UAW-Detroit Three contracts have tended toward incremental change, with worker gains offset by provisions that allowed the companies to drive costs down with automation and process efficiency. Referring to Biblical scripture, Fain asked union members: ""Are you willing to have faith and move that mountain? Nobody’s coming to save us."" Fain, whose grandfather was a UAW member, has escalated his rhetoric - and his stagecraft - since bargaining kicked off in July. In one of his early Facebook Live videos, he delivered his message wearing a black T-shirt with a quotation from Malcolm X on the back. The Wednesday before contract expiration, he said UAW members must fight for a better contract ""by any means necessary"" - one of Malcolm X's most quoted phrases. The crucial test for Fain's strategy comes as the current contracts with the Detroit Three expire. In 2019, the union launched a strike against GM when the company refused to agree to a contract by the deadline. That six-week strike cost GM $3.6 billion and stressed the finances of UAW members. The union has since beefed up its strike fund to $825 million, but the automakers have much more in cash and weeks of inventory they can run down. ""The UAW needs to be careful not to overplay their hand, as the balance sheets of The Detroit Three are flush with cash and they can probably wait things out longer than the workers can,"" wrote CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson. Other unions, including Teamsters at delivery giant United Parcel Service (UPS.N) and writers and actors in Hollywood, have also been emboldened, and some including UPS have won substantial raises. The actors have been on strike for more than 60 days; the writers, more than 100 days. Like the Hollywood unions, the UAW members at the Detroit Three face threats from new technology that a richer contract will not resolve. Company executives have said the UAW's demands will make them uncompetitive as the shift to EVs offsets the profits delivered by the combustion trucks UAW members build. Ford CEO Jim Farley went even further in a CNBC interview on the day of contract expiration: ""You want us to choose bankruptcy over supporting our workers,"" he said. Fain dismisses those warnings. ""They pretend the sky will fall if we get our fair share of the quarter of a trillion dollars the Big Three have made over the past decade,"" Fain said. ""It’s the billionaire economy - that's what they are worried about."" (This story has been corrected to fix the length of time for the actors' strike to 60 days in paragraph 19)"
Ford’s boss evokes empty threats in union battle,https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/fords-boss-evokes-empty-threats-union-battle-2023-09-15/,"NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford Motor (F.N) boss Jim Farley is breaking out the ""B"" word. In a Thursday interview with CNBC, Farley said that pay-rise demands from the United Auto Workers would have driven Ford “bankrupt” if implemented back during 2019 contract negotiations. For now, using “bankrupt” and “Ford” in the same sentence seems like an empty threat. Even in the event of a prolonged strike, Ford has a buffer. The company is sitting on $10 billion of cash net of debt and $47 billion in total liquidity. General Motors (GM.N) estimated a 40-day strike in 2019 led to $3.6 billion of operating losses. Such pain wouldn’t be pretty for shareholders, but it’s hardly a cash problem. That bundle of dough is also a tempting target. Take Farley at his word that Ford would have lost $15 billion over the last four years if the UAW’s wishlist had been in place. That implies around $9 billion of extra costs in North America. Sure, that might push free cash flow negative this year.

Audi exec says lower tax on imported EVs will help test India market,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/audi-exec-says-lower-tax-imported-evs-will-help-test-india-market-2023-09-15/,"BENGALURU, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE)-owned Audi's India unit said on Friday that any potential cut down on electric vehicle (EV) import taxes would help the German carmaker experiment better with models and pricing in the world's third-largest car market. ""If we get a window of three to five years where the government is able to reduce the duties, it will let us experiment what models make sense for India and help in terms of pricing points,"" Audi India head Balbir Singh Dhillon told Reuters on the sidelines of a showroom launch in Bengaluru. Reuters reported last month that the Indian government is working on a new EV policy that would slash import taxes for automakers that commit to some local manufacturing. Dhillon said that the India arm is in talks with the German parent to initiate assembling ""some"" of its electric cars locally, but declined to provide details on timeline or potential models. Audi is trying to catch up with its peers, BMW (BMWG.DE) and Mercedes (MBGn.DE), in the transition to electric. Currently, the company's India arm only makes internal combustion engines locally, which is used in its petrol cars. India's commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, said earlier in the week that the government will consult with the industry and come out with a new policy to attract greater EV investments. The efforts come as India pushes towards greener mobility, with the government hoping to increase electric car sales to 30% by 2030 from current nascent levels of 2%. Of this, luxury EVs are a fraction. After four models launched last month, six out of 16 models in Audi India's offerings are electric cars, which are entirely imported and sold in the country priced between $136,000 and $234,000."
Unions call for one-day strike at Stellantis' Melfi plant in Italy over new models,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/unions-call-one-day-strike-stellantis-melfi-plant-italy-over-new-models-2023-09-15/,"MILAN, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Unions called for a one-day strike at Stellantis' (STLAM.MI) Melfi plant in southern Italy on Sept. 18 over lack of new details by the carmaker about its future production there, UILM, FIM-CISL, Fismic and Uglm said on Friday. The Franco-Italian group in June said it planned to produce five new models in Melfi - where it employs more than 5,000 workers - with the fifth one ""subject to performance improvement"". Unions said in a statement that Stellantis, in a meeting held on Friday, declined to give them updates on the fifth model and on which models it will assemble at the facility, pending talks with the Italian government over a wider deal. Marco Lomio, the local head of UILM, said Melfi workers are called to an 8 hour strike on each of Monday's three scheduled shifts, with a total halt of the facility on that day. The strike is not related to the ongoing action by United Auto Workers in the U.S. at three factories owned by General Motors (GM.N), Ford Motor (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis. Stellantis was not available for comment."
"What industry experts, leaders say about the autoworkers' strike",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/what-industry-experts-leaders-say-about-us-auto-workers-strike-2023-09-15/,"Sept 15 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union launched simultaneous strikes at three factories owned by General Motors (GM.N), Ford (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) on Friday, kicking off the most ambitious U.S. industrial labor action in decades. The walkouts will halt production of the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado pickup truck, along with other popular models. Here is what people are saying about the unprecedented walkouts: GM CEO MARY BARRA TO CNBC: ""Every negotiation takes on the personality of the leader who's running, you know, from a UAW perspective, as well as what the situational issues are at the time. But I think the key in any of this is to get to the table, talk through the issues. And then that's what we've been working to do."" SAM FIORANI, PRODUCTION FORECASTER AT AUTO FORECAST SOLUTIONS: ""This is more of a symbolic strike than an actual damaging one ... If the negotiations don't go in a direction that (UAW President Shawn) Fain thinks is positive, we can fully expect a larger strike coming in a week or two."" DAN IVES, ANALYST AT WEDBUSH: ""If the strike lasts longer than three to four weeks, it will be moderately detrimental to GM and Ford's EV strategy in 2024...While the Detroit stalwarts battle with the UAW, there's a bottle of champagne that's being iced at Tesla (TSLA.O) headquarters."" KOJI ENDO, HEAD OF EQUITY RESEARCH, SBI SECURITIES: ""It's still not known to what percentage wage hike the UAW and the Big 3 will agree, but if it for example leads to a 15% or 20% wage hike for the UAW, Japanese manufacturers (whose workers) do not belong to the UAW will also have to raise wages (by) about the same amount, otherwise workers at Japanese factories will disappear."" LEE JAE-IL, ANALYST AT EUGENE INVESTMENT & SECURITIES: ""For South Korean automakers, the UAW strike could help raise their car prices in the United States due to production cuts, and that could create a seller's market environment. Also, it could potentially help increase its car exports to the United States. However, production disruptions at parts suppliers that supply to GM would be inevitable."" ARTHUR WHEATON, DIRECTOR OF LABOR STUDIES AT CORNELL SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS: ""It's not a devastating hit to the communities. It's not a devastating hit for the strike fund. It's not a devastating hit on the balance sheet for any of the automakers but it starts to raise the stakes, which was the intent."" ""I think they are making progress at the table... the initial (automaker) offers were much lower, like 9% (wage) increases and now you're up to 20% for increases. So that's more than double. You're seeing the UAW come down. You're no longer hearing anything about the 32-hour work week from the UAW."" STELLANTIS: ""We are extremely disappointed by the UAW leadership's refusal to engage in a responsible manner to reach a fair agreement in the best interest of our employees, their families and our customers. We immediately put the Company in contingency mode and will take all the appropriate structural decisions to protect our North American operations and the Company."" DEMOCRATIC U.S. REPRESENTATIVE ELISSA SLOTKIN OF MICHIGAN: ""I'm looking forward to joining our auto workers on the picket line this weekend. For the sake of Michigan's economy and our working families, I hope this strike is short-lived ... I hope the UAW and the Big Three continue to negotiate in good faith to reach a fair agreement as quickly as possible."" JAY TIMMONS, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS PRESIDENT: ""The impact of this strike will echo far beyond the city of Detroit as multiple economic analyses have demonstrated. The small and medium-sized manufacturers across the country that make up the automotive sector's integrated supply chain will feel the brunt of this work stoppage, whether they are a union shop or not."" MONICA BOSIO, ANALYST AT INTESA SANPAOLO: ""While at this stage the final impact of the strikes on selected plants is difficult to quantify, we highlight that amongst the Big Three, Stellantis is the most profitable one and could leverage on a lower break-even point as well as on higher inventories days than GM and Ford."" MARTINO DE AMBROGGI, ANALYST AT EQUITA: ""We confirm our idea that if the strike were to last less than two weeks it could be recovered by the end of the year, while if it were to last longer it could compromise Q4 performance."" DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: ""The all Electric (car) is a disaster for both the United Auto Workers and the American Consumer. They will all be built in China and, they are too expensive, don't go far enough, take too long to charge, and pose various dangers under certain atmospheric conditions. If this happens, the UAW will be wiped out, along with all other auto workers in the United States. The all Electric Car policy is about as dumb as Open Borders and No Voter I.D. IT IS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISASTER!"" ""Pickups likely hit next. Despite ""targeted"", very soon, the strike could hit max pain for OEMs given SUV/pickup profitability. The targeted strike is intended to give UAW flexibility strike fund duration."" ""The Detroit Three could face uncertainty & volatility for well over a year. Transmission plants could be future targets, though needed strike pay for MI workers adds cost."" ""These (plants) were chosen carefully by the UAW and reflect a strategy that will ensure a large number of suppliers and dealers are affected, while reducing the number of UAW workers that, at least initially, are on strike and receiving strike pay."" ""Despite the noise around the strike, based on public comments by company management and our understanding of the process, Ford appears closest to getting a deal done in terms of procedure and numbers, GM may not be too far behind, but Stellantis has a long way to go."" ""While the UAW strike actions could prove quite costly for the Detroit 3, we currently do not expect such to result in negative credit implications of a magnitude sufficient to result in a change in the ratings or in the trends on the ratings on GM, Ford or Stellantis."" ""The UAW strike and indeed the 'summer of strikes' is the natural result of the Biden administration's 'whole of government' approach to promoting unionization at all costs."""
EV maker VinFast seeks 'daring' applicants in India hiring drive,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ev-maker-vinfast-seeks-daring-applicants-india-hiring-drive-2023-09-15/,"NEW DELHI/HANOI, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Vietnamese electric vehicle (EV) maker VinFast has begun hiring in India, seeking recruits who ""dare to think, dare to do, and dare to face difficulties,"" according to a LinkedIn ad. The loss-making startup, whose market value has roughly halved since its blowout $85 billion Wall Street debut last month, said earlier this week it planned to set up in several countries including India, but gave no timing or details. The LinkedIn post shows it is seeking to fill sales, legal and back office jobs in India, among others. Formed and almost entirely controlled by Pham Nhat Vuong, Vietnam's richest person and founder of parent conglomerate Vingroup (VIC.HM), VinFast is currently valued at close to $39 billion. It is looking for people to join the company's office in Gurugram, a satellite city on the outskirts of the Indian capital New Delhi, ""for multiple roles across all areas of automotive business"", the LinkedIn job ad said. Asked about the ad, VinFast said it was researching the market and would provide ""official information"" in a couple of weeks. The ad said the company, which competes with Tesla (TSLA.O), was looking to hire dealer managers, sales training managers and service quality control personnel. It wants people for legal, finance and human resource work too. ""Suitable candidates need to have at least three years of experience ... along with daring personal traits: dare to think, dare to do, and dare to face difficulties,"" it said, adding that jobs would come with ""attractive compensation"". If VinFast enters India, the world's third-largest car market, it will compete in a nascent but fast-growing segment currently dominated by domestic heavyweight Tata Motors (TAMO.NS). Tesla is also eyeing India, and is in talks with New Delhi about setting up a factory. Electric models accounted for just around 2% of total car sales in India last year, but the government wants this to reach 30% by 2030. It is working on a new scheme to attract EV makers by offering them lower import taxes in return for investment in local manufacturing, Reuters reported last month. In a U.S. regulatory filing earlier this week, VinFast said it planned to invest $1.2 billion in Indonesia to sell cars and build a factory there."

DEMOCRATIC U.S. REPRESENTATIVE ELISSA SLOTKIN OF MICHIGAN: ""I stand with the men and women of the UAW who are doing the most American thing you can do: fighting to make sure a hard day’s work means a good life for you and your family. For the last two years, we’ve passed bills to incentivize American manufacturing and bring supply chains home from places like China. But the companies that benefit from these policies need to do right by the workers who make their success possible. ""I’m looking forward to joining our auto workers on the picket line this weekend. For the sake of Michigan’s economy and our working families, I hope this strike is short-lived. As someone who used to negotiate international agreements, I know that no one should let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

""American families are already feeling economic pressures from near-record-high inflation, and this will only inflict more pain. We urge a swift resolution to end this strike and avoid further undermining the strength of our industry and harming our broader economy."" ""Our autoworkers are the backbone of the industry.

UAW nears strike at Detroit Three as Ford blasts union,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/detroit-three-strike-deadline-nears-sides-remain-far-apart-2023-09-14/,"Sept 14 (Reuters) - A first-ever simultaneous strike at the Detroit Three carmakers by the United Auto Workers grew all but certain on Thursday with little progress reported in talks hours before a contract deadline expires. The union - which represents 146,000 U.S. auto workers - is asking for 40% pay raises through September 2027 and major improvements in benefits as part of what it calls ""audacious"" demands. The UAW has outlined plans for a series of strikes targeting individual, undisclosed U.S. auto plants if agreements are not reached by 11:59 pm ET Thursday, rather than a full walkout. The union plans to disclose the initial plants during a 10 p.m. ET event. Ford Motor (F.N) CEO Jim Farley told CNN the proposal to hike wages by 40% would ""put us out of business."" He said there were no talks going on, and that the automaker has received no counteroffer to its plan to offer 20% pay hikes. U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday spoke with UAW President Shawn Fain and leaders of the car companies to discuss the status of negotiations, the White House said. Just 10 days ago, Biden had expressed optimism that a strike could be averted, saying: ""I'm not worried about a strike ... I don't think it's going to happen."" General Motors (GM.N) earlier said it hiked its contract offer to a 20% wage hike for U.S. autoworkers over four and a half years - including 10% in the first year - to avoid a strike that is set to begin at midnight if no deal is reached. GM CEO Mary Barra told employees the company still hoped to reach a deal: ""Remember: we had a strike in 2019 and nobody won."" GM reported a $3.6 billion pre-tax loss in 2019 after the 42-day walkout. The third Detroit automaker, Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI), has offered pay hikes of 17.5%, the union has said. Coordinated strikes would represent arguably the most ambitious U.S. labor action in decades and could impact U.S. economic growth, depending on how long they last. The UAW's demands include restoring defined benefit pensions for all workers, 32-hour work weeks and additional cost-of-living hikes, as well as job security guarantees and an end to the use of temporary workers. Ford's Farley said if the UAW proposal had already been in effect the company would have lost about $15 billion from 2019-2022 instead of earning about $30 billion and ""gone bankrupt by now."" He criticized the lack of talks Thursday. ""Nothing is going on,"" he told CNBC. The UAW responded to the comments on social media saying Farley ""made $21 million last year."" The UAW's Fain said Wednesday a strike was likely as automakers rejected the pension, 32-hour work week and other benefit improvements sought. He also criticized proposed changes to profit sharing that would cut payments to workers. UAW organizing director Brian O. Shepherd said in an online event Thursday that the strike strategy is to give ""negotiators maximum flexibility"" to get autoworkers ""the contract they deserve."" He added a full walkout ""is still on the table."" Fain has said the pay raises offered by the Detroit Three to auto workers were inadequate even as automakers said the union had yet to formally respond to their latest, more generous offers. ""The clear winner in this Game of Thrones Battle between the UAW vs. GM/Ford is Tesla,"" said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. The Detroit automakers could face higher costs and complexity in the future that Tesla and other non-union automakers will not face as they expand electric vehicle production, he said. The U.S. auto sector, including parts manufacturers, employs almost 1 million people, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Biden administration officials are discussing emergency aid to protect smaller firms that supply U.S. auto manufacturers, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. The White House declined to comment. Fain outlined a strategy to ""create confusion"" with a series of work stoppages targeting individual U.S. plants if no deal is reached. Stopping work at a key engine or transmission plant, for example, could have a cascading effect by depriving other factories of parts they need to produce vehicles. Another option would be to strike at profitable pickup truck or SUV assembly plants. Fain said it was still possible that at a later date all of the auto workers could strike. A full strike would hit earnings at each affected automaker by about $400 million to $500 million per week assuming all production was lost, Deutsche Bank has estimated. Some losses could be recouped by boosting production schedules after a strike, but that possibility fades as a strike extends to weeks or months. A UAW strike would not affect European and Asian carmakers like Toyota, Honda and Mercedes, whose U.S. plant workers are not represented by the union. The UAW said it was planning a rally in Detroit on Friday that will include Fain, Senator Bernie Sanders and other members of Congress, coinciding with a first of day of expected walkouts."
Ford CEO says UAW proposal could force bankruptcy,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-ceo-says-uaw-proposal-could-force-bankruptcy-2023-09-14/,"Sept 14 (Reuters) - Ford Motor (F.N) Chief Executive Jim Farley said Thursday the United Auto Workers union proposal to hike wages by 40%, cut workweeks and add new pension benefits could bankrupt the company. ""You want us to choose bankruptcy over supporting our workers,"" Farley, in a CNBC interview, said of the UAW proposal. He said there are no current talks, and the automaker has received no counteroffer. ""Nothing is going on."" Farley said if the UAW proposal had been in effect since 2019, instead of making about $30 billion in profits over four years, the company would have lost about $15 billion ""and gone bankrupt by now."""
"As UAW strike looms, Biden administration considers aid for small suppliers, source says",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-strike-looms-biden-admin-considers-aid-small-suppliers-source-2023-09-14/,"Sept 14 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration is discussing emergency aid to protect smaller firms that supply U.S. auto manufacturers if the United Auto Workers union goes on strike, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. The Detroit Three automakers and union negotiators offered little hope a deal would be reached on Thursday to avoid a midnight walk-off that would be the UAW's first-ever simultaneous strike against the U.S. carmakers. The UAW has outlined plans for a series of strikes targeting individual, undisclosed U.S. auto plants, rather than a full walkout, if agreements are not reached by the contract expiration. Aid for suppliers has been discussed ""since the minute it became clear there could be a strike"" but those talks are ""premature and fluid,"" the source said. Auto suppliers held recent discussions with the White House about the potential impact of a strike and possible options that the Biden administration could tap to help suppliers weather a prolonged strike. The worry is that ""tier-1 suppliers will still be able to weather the storm financially,"" but it's the ones down the line that can't withstand the ""impact beyond six to eight weeks,"" the source said. The Washington Post was first to report such aid was being considered, and said options could include grants from the Labor Department to workers or loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA) to companies. The White House had no comment. The Labor Department and the SBA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Many smaller U.S. manufacturers that supply parts to the Detroit Three automakers are in a weak financial condition after the shock of pandemic shutdowns and subsequent semiconductor shortages that depressed vehicle production at the three companies for much of the past three years. The auto parts manufacturing industry employs 4.8 million people, according to the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association trade group. Many of those jobs are in Michigan, Ohio and other Midwestern states, as well as the Canadian province of Ontario. Small suppliers are critical to automakers' supply chains. If even one bracket or bolt or plastic interior part doesn't arrive at an assembly line, production could stop. Automakers have spent much of the past three years dealing with supply chain disruptions, and are still working to recover."
"Tata Motors tests export markets for EVs, to roll out EV-only dealerships in India",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tata-motors-tests-export-markets-evs-roll-out-ev-only-dealerships-india-2023-09-14/,"NEW DELHI, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Tata Motors (TAMO.NS), India's biggest electric carmaker, is testing its electric vehicles in some global markets where it could look at a potential launch if the experiment succeeds, its managing director told Reuters. The tests are in early stages and based on how the cars perform, Tata may need to make some changes to the product before it can finalise and develop a ""go to market"" strategy, Shailesh Chandra said in an interview. ""It is about which markets I should be in, with what products and with what kind of distribution strategy. We are assessing some markets, running our cars, discussing with business partners,"" he said. Chandra said it was too early to discuss details of the export markets and there would be more clarity next year. Tata also plans to roll out new car dealerships over coming quarters in some Indian cities that will exclusively sell EVs as sales of its clean cars gain momentum and it lines up faster launches of new electric models, Chandra said. Sales of EVs globally have been growing as tighter emission regulations push carmakers to increase the share of electric cars in their portfolio. While Tesla (TSLA.O) still leads the EV race, Chinese rivals like BYD (002594.SZ) are catching up with new factories and aggressive exports. Tata Motors, which already sells three EV models, launched its fourth electric car in New Delhi on Thursday - a new version of its Nexon electric SUV with a starting price of 1.5 million rupees ($18,000), which can be driven for 465 kilometres (289 miles) on a single charge. The EV maker has a more than 80% share of India's electric car market, which is small but growing, and where it competes with China's MG Motor and home-grown Mahindra & Mahindra (MAHM.NS). Tesla is also eyeing an India factory and is in talks with the government to build a $24,000 car. Electric models made up about 2% of total car sales in India of 3.9 million last fiscal year and the government wants to grow this to 30% by 2030. The Mumbai-based automaker has said it plans to have 10 electric cars in its portfolio over the next 3-4 years with EVs making up 25% of its total car sales by 2025. Chandra said the company is on track to meet its targets, including plans to sell around 100,000 EVs in the current fiscal year. Growing sales and the new Nexon EV have become the catalyst for its plan to launch EV-only dealerships, Chandra said. ""It is not going to be a pan-India roll out, it is going to be a progressive roll out. We want to understand fully the implication of an exclusive outlet versus what we were selling with the existing outlets,"" Chandra said. Tata has a country-wide dealership network for its gasoline and diesel cars through which it currently also sells its EVs. Chandra said the roll out of new EV outlets would be in small and big cities, depending on its current network of dealerships. Tata's ability to ramp up production of its EVs and launch new electric car models at a faster pace will also support its plan for new dealerships, which can now offer a broader portfolio, making them more viable, Chandra said. ""Earlier, the bigger problem was our lack of assessment of demand ... today we are very well prepared to deal with a faster ramp up,"" he said. ($1 = 83.0000 Indian rupees)"
"UAW prepares to strike at Detroit Three automakers, rejects new offers",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-president-lot-work-remaining-reach-auto-labor-deals-2023-09-13/,"Sept 13 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers on Wednesday outlined plans for a series of strikes targeting individual U.S. auto plants in what would be its first-ever simultaneous strike against the Detroit Three automakers if agreements are not reached by late Thursday. ""To win, we're likely going to have to take action,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a Facebook Live address, adding the UAW was not planning company-wide walkouts if no deal was reached but would escalate if negotiations did not improve. ""We are preparing to strike these companies in a way they have never seen before."", Fain said the Detroit Three automakers had offered 146,000 U.S. autoworkers pay raises of as much as 20% over four and a half years but called the hikes inadequate even as automakers protested the union had yet to formally respond to their latest more generous offers. Fain outlined a strategy to ""create confusion"" with a series of work stoppages targeting individual U.S. plants if no deal is reached but did not disclose which plants it planned to strike. ""We're going to hit where we need to hit,"" Fain said. Coordinated strikes would mark the first-ever simultaneous labor stoppage at all three Detroit automakers and one of the largest U.S. industrial labor actions in recent years. ""We're making progress ... but we're still very far apart on our key priorities,"" Fain said, adding the UAW will disclose which plants it will strike Thursday when the current four-year contracts expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time. Ford Motor (F.N) has proposed a 20% hike in pay, General Motors (GM.N) 18%, and Chrysler-parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) 17.5%, Fain said. That is less than half of the 40% pay hikes the union has sought, including an immediate 20% hike on ratification of a contract and 5% annual hikes, but higher than the initial offers the companies made. Ford said it had made four counteroffers and blasted the UAW saying the company had ""not received any genuine counteroffers from the union"" and added ""we should be working creatively to solve hard problems rather than planning strikes and PR events."" Stellantis said it is ""still awaiting the UAW’s response to the offer we presented yesterday."" GM said it continues ""to bargain directly and in good faith with the UAW and have presented additional strong offers. We are making progress in key areas."" Ford warned of a grim scenario. ""The future of our industry is at stake. Let’s do everything we can to avert a disastrous outcome."" The union's demands include restoring defined benefit pensions for all workers, 32-hour work weeks and additional cost-of-living hikes, as well as job security guarantees and an end to the use of temporary workers. Fain said automakers had rejected pension, 32-hour work week and other benefits. He also criticized proposed changes to profit sharing that would cut payments to workers. A UAW strike that shuts the Detroit Three manufacturers for 10 days could cost carmakers, suppliers and workers over $5 billion, Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group estimated, and could lead to a disruption of the broader auto supplier network. U.S. President Joe Biden has encouraged the parties to stay at the table ""to get a win-win agreement that keeps UAW workers at the heart of our auto future,"" White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein said Wednesday. Biden called top executives from all three automakers last week to ""encourage them to provide more forward-leaning offers to stay at the table,"" Bernstein added. AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler told Reuters autoworkers do not want to go on strike ""but they will if they have to in order to reach a fair deal."" Shuler noted there have been over 200 strikes this year in the United States. ""It's because the economy is broken. Workers are fed up,"" she said. The UAW said it is planning a rally in Detroit Friday that will include Fain, Senator Bernie Sanders and other members of Congress that would coincide with a first of day of walkouts. Targeting strategic plants could quickly force automakers to halt some or all U.S. production and could extend the time before the UAW's $825 million strike fund is exhausted.

The offer from Chrysler's parent company includes consolidating after-sales parts plants and increasing the number of supplemental workers the Jeep maker can use, the report said. UAW President Shawn Fain said on Wednesday that Stellantis had proposed a 17.5% pay hike. Union Vice President Rich Boyer criticized the proposal at a Friday rally in Detroit as ""concessionary"" and the result of concerns over the electrification transition, the report added. The first simultaneous strike against the Detroit Three automakers, launched on Friday, has halted production at three plants, producing the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, along with other popular models. The union, which represents 146,000 U.S. auto workers, has been asking for 40% pay raises through September 2027 and major improvements in benefits as part of what it calls ""audacious"" demands."
"UAW, automakers to resume talks as strike starts to create parts shortage",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-auto-union-strike-three-detroit-three-factories-2023-09-15/,"DETROIT, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers said it plans to resume bargaining on Saturday after launching its first simultaneous strikes at General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis, with effects of the limited shutdown starting to spread on Friday. The most ambitious U.S. industrial labor action in decades has halted production at three plants producing the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, along with other popular models. By Friday afternoon a ripple effect was felt. ""Our production system is highly interconnected, which means the UAW’s targeted strike strategy will have knock-on effects for facilities that are not directly targeted for a work stoppage,"" Ford (F.N) said in a statement. It told 600 workers who are not striking not come to work on Friday and GM (GM.N) told some 2,000 workers at a Kansas car plant that their factory likely would be shut down next week for lack of parts, stemming from a nearby plant being struck. At a rally on Friday afternoon and at picket lines during the day, union members protested loudly and took special aim at a two-tiered wage system that left new hires without the pay or benefits of seasoned hands. That was unfair and favored investors over workers, they said. ""We’re not going to wreck the economy. The truth is we are going to wreck the billionaire economy,"" said UAW President Shawn Fain. The union is demanding a bigger share of profits, shorter work weeks, restoration of defined benefit pensions and stronger job security as automakers shift to electric vehicles. UAW vice president Chuck Browning, who is leading talks with Ford, told a rally of hundreds of UAW workers in downtown Detroit on Friday afternoon that recent talks have made ""good progress, but we have far to go."" U.S. President Joe Biden, who faces re-election next year, called for the auto companies to reward workers just as executives' salaries have risen. ""The companies have made some significant offers but I believe they should go further to ensure record corporate profits mean record contracts,"" he said. Striking workers said ""tier two"" employees can make only half the hourly wages of senior UAW workers and get worse benefits. ""That's the biggest thing I hear in our plant: we were built on equal pay for equal work,"" said Bruce Baumhower, the UAW president for the local including the striking Stellantis (STLAM.MI), Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio. Some two-tier systems were set in place during bankruptcies more than a decade ago. The starting wage for tier two workers of $15.78 now is on par with fast food restaurants and has not changed since it was set 14 years ago, he said. ""Fourteen years later, our workers are still in bankruptcy,"" he added. None of the Detroit Three has proposed eliminating those tiered wage systems, a key UAW demand, but they have offered to cut the time needed to reach top pay to four from eight years. ""I think they are making progress at the table,"" said Arthur Wheaton, who teaches collective bargaining at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor relations. Automakers have raised wage offers and the UAW appears to be focusing its demands. ""You're no longer hearing anything about the 32-hours work week from the UAW,"" he said. Executives say the union's asks would make the automakers uncompetitive against other nonunion rivals. Ford CEO Jim Farley said the UAW's 40% wage hike demand would ""put us out of business."" GM CEO Mary Barra on ""CBS This Morning"" on Friday said ""We still have a ways to go with the offer they put on the table last night."" Senator Bernie Sanders, speaking at the Friday rally, retorted, “I say to Ms. Barra, do you have any idea what it’s like for one of your workers to survive on $17 an hour?” Friday's walkout was smaller than some analysts expected. ""Keep the other plants open,"" said Sofus Nielsen, a 29-year Ford veteran, outside the Wayne plant. ""This way we can be out here longer and hurt them more.” The UAW has an $825 million strike fund but the automakers have built up billions thanks to robust profits from trucks and SUVs. Biden on Friday said acting Labor Secretary Julie Su and adviser Gene Sperling will travel to Detroit to offer support for talks but the White House said they would not mediate. Ford shares ended barely changed on Friday, GM stock rose about 1% and Stellantis shares earlier closed up 1.9% in Milan. The automakers have offered up to 20% wage hikes, without key benefits demanded by the union. Ford said the UAW's latest proposals would double its U.S. labor costs and make it uncompetitive against Tesla (TSLA.O) and other nonunion rivals. Stellantis said it had immediately gone into ""contingency mode"" and would take structural decisions to protect the company and its North American operations, without elaborating. Nearly half the 12,700 striking workers are at the Stellantis plant, although management has been preparing: a parking lot of finished Jeeps is more than a mile long outside the factory. GM said on Thursday the UAW wage and benefits proposals would cost the automaker $100 billion, but did not elaborate. Fain has rejected the automakers' assertions, saying the companies have spent billions on share buybacks and executive salaries. While Biden is pouring billions in federal subsidies into expanding electric-vehicle sales, this shift could threaten combustion powertrain jobs. The UAW has not endorsed his re-election. Biden's likely opponent, former president Donald Trump, on Friday criticized the shift to EVs as a job-killer for the UAW."
Detroit Three plants where UAW is on strike,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/detroit-three-plants-where-uaw-plans-strike-2023-09-15/,"Sept 15 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union began unprecedented, simultaneous walkouts at General Motors (GM.N), Ford (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis' (STLAM.MI) U.S. operations early on Friday after failing to reach pay deals with the automakers. The walkouts cap weeks of clashes between the union and Detroit Three executives over union demands for a bigger share of profits generated by combustion trucks, and stronger job security as automakers shift to electric vehicles. These are the first plants where strikes are taking place: Wentzville, Missouri assembly plant About 3,600 UAW members Products produced: Chevrolet Colorado and Express; GMC Canyon and Savanna FORD Wayne, Michigan assembly plant, excluding stamping plant About 3,300 UAW members Products produced: Ford Ranger and Bronco STELLANTIS Toledo, Ohio assembly plant About 5,800 UAW members Products produced: Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator"
Biden wants automakers to give UAW workers more in strike talks,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-address-us-auto-negotiations-friday-white-house-2023-09-15/,"WASHINGTON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday called on automakers to concede more to workers who walked off the job at Detroit's largest car companies, accusing them of enjoying record profits without sharing them fairly with workers. The UAW strike at three factories owned by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler-owner Stellantis kicked off the most ambitious U.S. industrial labor action in decades. ""No one wants a strike, but I respect workers' right to use their options under the collective bargaining"" system, Biden said. ""I understand their frustration."" The auto companies have made some significant offers in negotiations so far, Biden said. ""But I believe they should go further to ensure record corporate profits mean record contracts for the UAW,"" he said, echoing sentiments by union leaders. Labor unions like the UAW - which represents 146,000 workers - are key to Biden's game plan for winning reelection in 2024. He needs their support to win key states like Pennsylvania and Michigan again, which stand to bear the brunt of any major strikes against carmakers. The UAW has yet to endorse Biden, the only major union not to do so. A prolonged strike could be a drag on a U.S. economy that has been performing better than expected, but is unlikely to lead to a recession, analysts say. Biden said he would dispatch two members of his team, Gene Sperling and Labor Secretary Julie Su, to Detroit to ensure the administration is involved in talks and a ""win-win agreement."" Biden, who had predicted over the Labor Day weekend that the union would not strike, spoke to union and automaker leaders on Thursday. The Biden administration is also discussing emergency aid to protect smaller firms that supply U.S. auto manufacturers, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. Former U.S. President Trump, who is the leading Republican challenger for Biden's 2024 re-election bid, criticized Biden's push for electric vehicles on social media as a ""total disaster"" and attacked UAW leaders in an interview to be aired Sunday. ""The auto workers are being sold down the river by their leadership,"" Trump said in the interview with NBC's Meet the Press. Under Trump, auto companies ""would likely have gone bankrupt,"" the Biden campaign said in a statement. ""Trump will say literally anything to distract from his long record of breaking promises and failing America's workers."" The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, one of the largest business lobby groups, blamed Biden on Friday for the strikes, and said they would result in higher costs for workers not in a union and lost profits for other businesses. ""The UAW strike and indeed 'the summer of strikes' is the natural result of the Biden administration's whole of government approach to promoting unionization at all costs,"" said Suzanne Clark, the group's chief executive, urging both groups to return to the bargaining table and end the strike. Biden, 80, is tying his 2024 re-election bid to the health of the economy, highlighting job growth, rising wages and fading recession fears, which a prolonged strike could threaten."
GM expects to be forced to idle Kansas auto plant next week,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-expects-be-forced-idle-kansas-auto-plant-next-week-2023-09-15/,"Sept 15 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM.N) said on Friday it expects to be forced to idle operations at its Kansas assembly plant next week after the United Auto Workers union struck a nearby Missouri plant earlier in the day - the first ripple effect from the walkout. The Detroit automaker said the Wentzville, Missouri, plant, where workers went on strike, is providing critical stampings to its Fairfax, Kansas, assembly plant. ""Due to the strike’s impact on Wentzville operations, we anticipate running out of parts for Fairfax as soon as early next week. The parts situation is fluid, and we are actively managing the situation,"" GM said. ""Since Fairfax won't be able to run production due to a part shortage caused by the strike in Wentzville, there is no work available."""
UAW Chief Shawn Fain disrupts Detroit's labor tradition,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-chief-shawn-fain-disrupts-detroits-labor-tradition-2023-09-15/,"Sept 15 (Reuters) - He is known to quote the Bible and Nation of Islam civil rights leader Malcolm X. He is a social media fanatic who keeps the pay stubs of his union member grandfather in his wallet. And now, Shawn Fain is representing nearly 150,000 auto workers in one of the biggest labor strikes in decades. In taking action against all three Detroit carmakers, Fain, the head of the United Auto Workers, has remade the strategy of the union he leads, choosing a bolder, much riskier path than his predecessors after he won office by a narrow margin in a first-ever direct election earlier this year. The strike started as the clock hit midnight on Friday, and followed Fain's decision to open negotiations with Ford Motor (F.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI) simultaneously and eschew public niceties involving choreographed handshakes that famously kicked off previous negotiating efforts. The strategy is not without risk. A weeks-long strike would hit workers who live paycheck to paycheck, while the Detroit Three automakers have billions in cash to withstand the walkout. Fain, 54, has made creative use of social media, appearances on network and cable news programs and alliances with high-profile progressive politicians such as U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, to reframe the UAW's contract bargaining as a battle to re-set the balance of power between workers and global corporations. He has rebutted automakers' concerns about labor costs by pointing out that they have poured billions into share buybacks to benefit investors. ""If they’ve got money for Wall Street they sure as hell have money for the workers making the product,"" he said. “We fight for the good of the entire working class and the poor."" In lengthy social media talks to UAW members, Fain alternates quoting Bible verses with the use of charts and graphs to dissect wage and benefit offers from the automakers - details his predecessors kept behind closed doors during bargaining crunch time. Fain, in his unorthodox approach, ran what amounted to a public auction among the companies to push each one to top the other to avoid a costly walkout. Prior UAW presidents picked just one automaker to set a pattern for the other two. Over and over, Fain has told UAW members at the Detroit Three that they can reverse 20 years of wage and retiree benefit concessions, stop further plant closures and end a seniority-based, tiered compensation system that pays new hires as much as 44% less than veteran workers. ""He's basically showing me who he is and where he comes from every time he presents himself. So, when he shows the plan, I can follow it. I understand that it’s a new way of going about things and I think he’s really shaking them up,” said Darwin Segers, 49, a UAW member who works at the Stellantis Mack Plant in Detroit. Achieving any one of those goals in one bargaining round would be a significant achievement. UAW-Detroit Three contracts have tended toward incremental change, with worker gains offset by provisions that allowed the companies to drive costs down with automation and process efficiency. Referring to Biblical scripture, Fain asked union members: ""Are you willing to have faith and move that mountain? Nobody’s coming to save us."" Fain, whose grandfather was a UAW member, has escalated his rhetoric - and his stagecraft - since bargaining kicked off in July. In one of his early Facebook Live videos, he delivered his message wearing a black T-shirt with a quotation from Malcolm X on the back. The Wednesday before contract expiration, he said UAW members must fight for a better contract ""by any means necessary"" - one of Malcolm X's most quoted phrases. The crucial test for Fain's strategy comes as the current contracts with the Detroit Three expire. In 2019, the union launched a strike against GM when the company refused to agree to a contract by the deadline. That six-week strike cost GM $3.6 billion and stressed the finances of UAW members. The union has since beefed up its strike fund to $825 million, but the automakers have much more in cash and weeks of inventory they can run down. ""The UAW needs to be careful not to overplay their hand, as the balance sheets of The Detroit Three are flush with cash and they can probably wait things out longer than the workers can,"" wrote CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson. Other unions, including Teamsters at delivery giant United Parcel Service (UPS.N) and writers and actors in Hollywood, have also been emboldened, and some including UPS have won substantial raises. The actors have been on strike for more than 60 days; the writers, more than 100 days. Like the Hollywood unions, the UAW members at the Detroit Three face threats from new technology that a richer contract will not resolve. Company executives have said the UAW's demands will make them uncompetitive as the shift to EVs offsets the profits delivered by the combustion trucks UAW members build. Ford CEO Jim Farley went even further in a CNBC interview on the day of contract expiration: ""You want us to choose bankruptcy over supporting our workers,"" he said. Fain dismisses those warnings. ""They pretend the sky will fall if we get our fair share of the quarter of a trillion dollars the Big Three have made over the past decade,"" Fain said. ""It’s the billionaire economy - that's what they are worried about."" (This story has been corrected to fix the length of time for the actors' strike to 60 days in paragraph 19)"
Ford’s boss evokes empty threats in union battle,https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/fords-boss-evokes-empty-threats-union-battle-2023-09-15/,"NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ford Motor (F.N) boss Jim Farley is breaking out the ""B"" word. In a Thursday interview with CNBC, Farley said that pay-rise demands from the United Auto Workers would have driven Ford “bankrupt” if implemented back during 2019 contract negotiations. For now, using “bankrupt” and “Ford” in the same sentence seems like an empty threat. Even in the event of a prolonged strike, Ford has a buffer. The company is sitting on $10 billion of cash net of debt and $47 billion in total liquidity. General Motors (GM.N) estimated a 40-day strike in 2019 led to $3.6 billion of operating losses. Such pain wouldn’t be pretty for shareholders, but it’s hardly a cash problem. That bundle of dough is also a tempting target. Take Farley at his word that Ford would have lost $15 billion over the last four years if the UAW’s wishlist had been in place. That implies around $9 billion of extra costs in North America. Sure, that might push free cash flow negative this year. But for now, profit is at the heart of this dispute.(By Jonathan Guilford) Follow @Breakingviews on X (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are their own.)

Audi exec says lower tax on imported EVs will help test India market,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/audi-exec-says-lower-tax-imported-evs-will-help-test-india-market-2023-09-15/,"BENGALURU, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE)-owned Audi's India unit said on Friday that any potential cut down on electric vehicle (EV) import taxes would help the German carmaker experiment better with models and pricing in the world's third-largest car market. ""If we get a window of three to five years where the government is able to reduce the duties, it will let us experiment what models make sense for India and help in terms of pricing points,"" Audi India head Balbir Singh Dhillon told Reuters on the sidelines of a showroom launch in Bengaluru. Reuters reported last month that the Indian government is working on a new EV policy that would slash import taxes for automakers that commit to some local manufacturing. Dhillon said that the India arm is in talks with the German parent to initiate assembling ""some"" of its electric cars locally, but declined to provide details on timeline or potential models. Audi is trying to catch up with its peers, BMW (BMWG.DE) and Mercedes (MBGn.DE), in the transition to electric. Currently, the company's India arm only makes internal combustion engines locally, which is used in its petrol cars. India's commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, said earlier in the week that the government will consult with the industry and come out with a new policy to attract greater EV investments. The efforts come as India pushes towards greener mobility, with the government hoping to increase electric car sales to 30% by 2030 from current nascent levels of 2%. Of this, luxury EVs are a fraction. After four models launched last month, six out of 16 models in Audi India's offerings are electric cars, which are entirely imported and sold in the country priced between $136,000 and $234,000."
Unions call for one-day strike at Stellantis' Melfi plant in Italy over new models,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/unions-call-one-day-strike-stellantis-melfi-plant-italy-over-new-models-2023-09-15/,"MILAN, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Unions called for a one-day strike at Stellantis' (STLAM.MI) Melfi plant in southern Italy on Sept. 18 over lack of new details by the carmaker about its future production there, UILM, FIM-CISL, Fismic and Uglm said on Friday. The Franco-Italian group in June said it planned to produce five new models in Melfi - where it employs more than 5,000 workers - with the fifth one ""subject to performance improvement"". Unions said in a statement that Stellantis, in a meeting held on Friday, declined to give them updates on the fifth model and on which models it will assemble at the facility, pending talks with the Italian government over a wider deal. Marco Lomio, the local head of UILM, said Melfi workers are called to an 8 hour strike on each of Monday's three scheduled shifts, with a total halt of the facility on that day. The strike is not related to the ongoing action by United Auto Workers in the U.S. at three factories owned by General Motors (GM.N), Ford Motor (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis. Stellantis was not available for comment."
"What industry experts, leaders say about the autoworkers' strike",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/what-industry-experts-leaders-say-about-us-auto-workers-strike-2023-09-15/,"Sept 15 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union launched simultaneous strikes at three factories owned by General Motors (GM.N), Ford (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) on Friday, kicking off the most ambitious U.S. industrial labor action in decades. The walkouts will halt production of the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado pickup truck, along with other popular models. Here is what people are saying about the unprecedented walkouts: GM CEO MARY BARRA TO CNBC: ""Every negotiation takes on the personality of the leader who's running, you know, from a UAW perspective, as well as what the situational issues are at the time. But I think the key in any of this is to get to the table, talk through the issues. And then that's what we've been working to do."" SAM FIORANI, PRODUCTION FORECASTER AT AUTO FORECAST SOLUTIONS: ""This is more of a symbolic strike than an actual damaging one ... If the negotiations don't go in a direction that (UAW President Shawn) Fain thinks is positive, we can fully expect a larger strike coming in a week or two."" DAN IVES, ANALYST AT WEDBUSH: ""If the strike lasts longer than three to four weeks, it will be moderately detrimental to GM and Ford's EV strategy in 2024...While the Detroit stalwarts battle with the UAW, there's a bottle of champagne that's being iced at Tesla (TSLA.O) headquarters."" KOJI ENDO, HEAD OF EQUITY RESEARCH, SBI SECURITIES: ""It's still not known to what percentage wage hike the UAW and the Big 3 will agree, but if it for example leads to a 15% or 20% wage hike for the UAW, Japanese manufacturers (whose workers) do not belong to the UAW will also have to raise wages (by) about the same amount, otherwise workers at Japanese factories will disappear."" LEE JAE-IL, ANALYST AT EUGENE INVESTMENT & SECURITIES: ""For South Korean automakers, the UAW strike could help raise their car prices in the United States due to production cuts, and that could create a seller's market environment. Also, it could potentially help increase its car exports to the United States. However, production disruptions at parts suppliers that supply to GM would be inevitable."" ARTHUR WHEATON, DIRECTOR OF LABOR STUDIES AT CORNELL SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS: ""It's not a devastating hit to the communities. It's not a devastating hit for the strike fund. It's not a devastating hit on the balance sheet for any of the automakers but it starts to raise the stakes, which was the intent."" ""I think they are making progress at the table... the initial (automaker) offers were much lower, like 9% (wage) increases and now you're up to 20% for increases. So that's more than double. You're seeing the UAW come down. You're no longer hearing anything about the 32-hour work week from the UAW."" STELLANTIS: ""We are extremely disappointed by the UAW leadership's refusal to engage in a responsible manner to reach a fair agreement in the best interest of our employees, their families and our customers. We immediately put the Company in contingency mode and will take all the appropriate structural decisions to protect our North American operations and the Company."" DEMOCRATIC U.S. REPRESENTATIVE ELISSA SLOTKIN OF MICHIGAN: ""I'm looking forward to joining our auto workers on the picket line this weekend. For the sake of Michigan's economy and our working families, I hope this strike is short-lived ... I hope the UAW and the Big Three continue to negotiate in good faith to reach a fair agreement as quickly as possible."" JAY TIMMONS, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS PRESIDENT: ""The impact of this strike will echo far beyond the city of Detroit as multiple economic analyses have demonstrated. The small and medium-sized manufacturers across the country that make up the automotive sector's integrated supply chain will feel the brunt of this work stoppage, whether they are a union shop or not."" MONICA BOSIO, ANALYST AT INTESA SANPAOLO: ""While at this stage the final impact of the strikes on selected plants is difficult to quantify, we highlight that amongst the Big Three, Stellantis is the most profitable one and could leverage on a lower break-even point as well as on higher inventories days than GM and Ford."" MARTINO DE AMBROGGI, ANALYST AT EQUITA: ""We confirm our idea that if the strike were to last less than two weeks it could be recovered by the end of the year, while if it were to last longer it could compromise Q4 performance."" DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: ""The all Electric (car) is a disaster for both the United Auto Workers and the American Consumer. They will all be built in China and, they are too expensive, don't go far enough, take too long to charge, and pose various dangers under certain atmospheric conditions. If this happens, the UAW will be wiped out, along with all other auto workers in the United States. The all Electric Car policy is about as dumb as Open Borders and No Voter I.D. IT IS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISASTER!"" ""Pickups likely hit next. Despite ""targeted"", very soon, the strike could hit max pain for OEMs given SUV/pickup profitability. The targeted strike is intended to give UAW flexibility strike fund duration."" ""The Detroit Three could face uncertainty & volatility for well over a year. Transmission plants could be future targets, though needed strike pay for MI workers adds cost."" ""These (plants) were chosen carefully by the UAW and reflect a strategy that will ensure a large number of suppliers and dealers are affected, while reducing the number of UAW workers that, at least initially, are on strike and receiving strike pay."" ""Despite the noise around the strike, based on public comments by company management and our understanding of the process, Ford appears closest to getting a deal done in terms of procedure and numbers, GM may not be too far behind, but Stellantis has a long way to go.""

EV maker VinFast seeks 'daring' applicants in India hiring drive,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ev-maker-vinfast-seeks-daring-applicants-india-hiring-drive-2023-09-15/,"NEW DELHI/HANOI, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Vietnamese electric vehicle (EV) maker VinFast has begun hiring in India, seeking recruits who ""dare to think, dare to do, and dare to face difficulties,"" according to a LinkedIn ad. The loss-making startup, whose market value has roughly halved since its blowout $85 billion Wall Street debut last month, said earlier this week it planned to set up in several countries including India, but gave no timing or details. The LinkedIn post shows it is seeking to fill sales, legal and back office jobs in India, among others. Formed and almost entirely controlled by Pham Nhat Vuong, Vietnam's richest person and founder of parent conglomerate Vingroup (VIC.HM), VinFast is currently valued at close to $39 billion. It is looking for people to join the company's office in Gurugram, a satellite city on the outskirts of the Indian capital New Delhi, ""for multiple roles across all areas of automotive business"", the LinkedIn job ad said. Asked about the ad, VinFast said it was researching the market and would provide ""official information"" in a couple of weeks. The ad said the company, which competes with Tesla (TSLA.O), was looking to hire dealer managers, sales training managers and service quality control personnel. It wants people for legal, finance and human resource work too. ""Suitable candidates need to have at least three years of experience ... along with daring personal traits: dare to think, dare to do, and dare to face difficulties,"" it said, adding that jobs would come with ""attractive compensation"". If VinFast enters India, the world's third-largest car market, it will compete in a nascent but fast-growing segment currently dominated by domestic heavyweight Tata Motors (TAMO.NS). Tesla is also eyeing India, and is in talks with New Delhi about setting up a factory. Electric models accounted for just around 2% of total car sales in India last year, but the government wants this to reach 30% by 2030. It is working on a new scheme to attract EV makers by offering them lower import taxes in return for investment in local manufacturing, Reuters reported last month. In a U.S. regulatory filing earlier this week, VinFast said it planned to invest $1.2 billion in Indonesia to sell cars and build a factory there."

UAW nears strike at Detroit Three as Ford blasts union,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/detroit-three-strike-deadline-nears-sides-remain-far-apart-2023-09-14/,"Sept 14 (Reuters) - A first-ever simultaneous strike at the Detroit Three carmakers by the United Auto Workers grew all but certain on Thursday with little progress reported in talks hours before a contract deadline expires. The union - which represents 146,000 U.S. auto workers - is asking for 40% pay raises through September 2027 and major improvements in benefits as part of what it calls ""audacious"" demands. The UAW has outlined plans for a series of strikes targeting individual, undisclosed U.S. auto plants if agreements are not reached by 11:59 pm ET Thursday, rather than a full walkout. The union plans to disclose the initial plants during a 10 p.m. ET event. Ford Motor (F.N) CEO Jim Farley told CNN the proposal to hike wages by 40% would ""put us out of business."" He said there were no talks going on, and that the automaker has received no counteroffer to its plan to offer 20% pay hikes. U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday spoke with UAW President Shawn Fain and leaders of the car companies to discuss the status of negotiations, the White House said. Just 10 days ago, Biden had expressed optimism that a strike could be averted, saying: ""I'm not worried about a strike ... I don't think it's going to happen."" General Motors (GM.N) earlier said it hiked its contract offer to a 20% wage hike for U.S. autoworkers over four and a half years - including 10% in the first year - to avoid a strike that is set to begin at midnight if no deal is reached. GM CEO Mary Barra told employees the company still hoped to reach a deal: ""Remember: we had a strike in 2019 and nobody won."" GM reported a $3.6 billion pre-tax loss in 2019 after the 42-day walkout. The third Detroit automaker, Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI), has offered pay hikes of 17.5%, the union has said. Coordinated strikes would represent arguably the most ambitious U.S. labor action in decades and could impact U.S. economic growth, depending on how long they last. The UAW's demands include restoring defined benefit pensions for all workers, 32-hour work weeks and additional cost-of-living hikes, as well as job security guarantees and an end to the use of temporary workers. Ford's Farley said if the UAW proposal had already been in effect the company would have lost about $15 billion from 2019-2022 instead of earning about $30 billion and ""gone bankrupt by now."" He criticized the lack of talks Thursday. ""Nothing is going on,"" he told CNBC. The UAW responded to the comments on social media saying Farley ""made $21 million last year."" The UAW's Fain said Wednesday a strike was likely as automakers rejected the pension, 32-hour work week and other benefit improvements sought. He also criticized proposed changes to profit sharing that would cut payments to workers. UAW organizing director Brian O. Shepherd said in an online event Thursday that the strike strategy is to give ""negotiators maximum flexibility"" to get autoworkers ""the contract they deserve."" He added a full walkout ""is still on the table."" Fain has said the pay raises offered by the Detroit Three to auto workers were inadequate even as automakers said the union had yet to formally respond to their latest, more generous offers. ""The clear winner in this Game of Thrones Battle between the UAW vs. GM/Ford is Tesla,"" said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. The Detroit automakers could face higher costs and complexity in the future that Tesla and other non-union automakers will not face as they expand electric vehicle production, he said. The U.S. auto sector, including parts manufacturers, employs almost 1 million people, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Biden administration officials are discussing emergency aid to protect smaller firms that supply U.S. auto manufacturers, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. The White House declined to comment. Fain outlined a strategy to ""create confusion"" with a series of work stoppages targeting individual U.S. plants if no deal is reached. Stopping work at a key engine or transmission plant, for example, could have a cascading effect by depriving other factories of parts they need to produce vehicles. Another option would be to strike at profitable pickup truck or SUV assembly plants. Fain said it was still possible that at a later date all of the auto workers could strike. A full strike would hit earnings at each affected automaker by about $400 million to $500 million per week assuming all production was lost, Deutsche Bank has estimated. Some losses could be recouped by boosting production schedules after a strike, but that possibility fades as a strike extends to weeks or months. A UAW strike would not affect European and Asian carmakers like Toyota, Honda and Mercedes, whose U.S. plant workers are not represented by the union. The UAW said it was planning a rally in Detroit on Friday that will include Fain, Senator Bernie Sanders and other members of Congress, coinciding with a first of day of expected walkouts."
Ford CEO says UAW proposal could force bankruptcy,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-ceo-says-uaw-proposal-could-force-bankruptcy-2023-09-14/,"Sept 14 (Reuters) - Ford Motor (F.N) Chief Executive Jim Farley said Thursday the United Auto Workers union proposal to hike wages by 40%, cut workweeks and add new pension benefits could bankrupt the company. ""You want us to choose bankruptcy over supporting our workers,"" Farley, in a CNBC interview, said of the UAW proposal. He said there are no current talks, and the automaker has received no counteroffer. ""Nothing is going on."" Farley said if the UAW proposal had been in effect since 2019, instead of making about $30 billion in profits over four years, the company would have lost about $15 billion ""and gone bankrupt by now."""
"As UAW strike looms, Biden administration considers aid for small suppliers, source says",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-strike-looms-biden-admin-considers-aid-small-suppliers-source-2023-09-14/,"Sept 14 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration is discussing emergency aid to protect smaller firms that supply U.S. auto manufacturers if the United Auto Workers union goes on strike, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. The Detroit Three automakers and union negotiators offered little hope a deal would be reached on Thursday to avoid a midnight walk-off that would be the UAW's first-ever simultaneous strike against the U.S. carmakers. The UAW has outlined plans for a series of strikes targeting individual, undisclosed U.S. auto plants, rather than a full walkout, if agreements are not reached by the contract expiration. Aid for suppliers has been discussed ""since the minute it became clear there could be a strike"" but those talks are ""premature and fluid,"" the source said. Auto suppliers held recent discussions with the White House about the potential impact of a strike and possible options that the Biden administration could tap to help suppliers weather a prolonged strike. The worry is that ""tier-1 suppliers will still be able to weather the storm financially,"" but it's the ones down the line that can't withstand the ""impact beyond six to eight weeks,"" the source said. The Washington Post was first to report such aid was being considered, and said options could include grants from the Labor Department to workers or loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA) to companies. The White House had no comment. The Labor Department and the SBA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Many smaller U.S. manufacturers that supply parts to the Detroit Three automakers are in a weak financial condition after the shock of pandemic shutdowns and subsequent semiconductor shortages that depressed vehicle production at the three companies for much of the past three years. The auto parts manufacturing industry employs 4.8 million people, according to the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association trade group. Many of those jobs are in Michigan, Ohio and other Midwestern states, as well as the Canadian province of Ontario. Small suppliers are critical to automakers' supply chains. If even one bracket or bolt or plastic interior part doesn't arrive at an assembly line, production could stop. Automakers have spent much of the past three years dealing with supply chain disruptions, and are still working to recover."
"Tata Motors tests export markets for EVs, to roll out EV-only dealerships in India",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tata-motors-tests-export-markets-evs-roll-out-ev-only-dealerships-india-2023-09-14/,"NEW DELHI, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Tata Motors (TAMO.NS), India's biggest electric carmaker, is testing its electric vehicles in some global markets where it could look at a potential launch if the experiment succeeds, its managing director told Reuters. The tests are in early stages and based on how the cars perform, Tata may need to make some changes to the product before it can finalise and develop a ""go to market"" strategy, Shailesh Chandra said in an interview. ""It is about which markets I should be in, with what products and with what kind of distribution strategy. We are assessing some markets, running our cars, discussing with business partners,"" he said. Chandra said it was too early to discuss details of the export markets and there would be more clarity next year. Tata also plans to roll out new car dealerships over coming quarters in some Indian cities that will exclusively sell EVs as sales of its clean cars gain momentum and it lines up faster launches of new electric models, Chandra said. Sales of EVs globally have been growing as tighter emission regulations push carmakers to increase the share of electric cars in their portfolio. While Tesla (TSLA.O) still leads the EV race, Chinese rivals like BYD (002594.SZ) are catching up with new factories and aggressive exports. Tata Motors, which already sells three EV models, launched its fourth electric car in New Delhi on Thursday - a new version of its Nexon electric SUV with a starting price of 1.5 million rupees ($18,000), which can be driven for 465 kilometres (289 miles) on a single charge. The EV maker has a more than 80% share of India's electric car market, which is small but growing, and where it competes with China's MG Motor and home-grown Mahindra & Mahindra (MAHM.NS). Tesla is also eyeing an India factory and is in talks with the government to build a $24,000 car. Electric models made up about 2% of total car sales in India of 3.9 million last fiscal year and the government wants to grow this to 30% by 2030. The Mumbai-based automaker has said it plans to have 10 electric cars in its portfolio over the next 3-4 years with EVs making up 25% of its total car sales by 2025. Chandra said the company is on track to meet its targets, including plans to sell around 100,000 EVs in the current fiscal year. Growing sales and the new Nexon EV have become the catalyst for its plan to launch EV-only dealerships, Chandra said. ""It is not going to be a pan-India roll out, it is going to be a progressive roll out. We want to understand fully the implication of an exclusive outlet versus what we were selling with the existing outlets,"" Chandra said. Tata has a country-wide dealership network for its gasoline and diesel cars through which it currently also sells its EVs. Chandra said the roll out of new EV outlets would be in small and big cities, depending on its current network of dealerships. Tata's ability to ramp up production of its EVs and launch new electric car models at a faster pace will also support its plan for new dealerships, which can now offer a broader portfolio, making them more viable, Chandra said. ""Earlier, the bigger problem was our lack of assessment of demand ... today we are very well prepared to deal with a faster ramp up,"" he said. ($1 = 83.0000 Indian rupees)"
"UAW prepares to strike at Detroit Three automakers, rejects new offers",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-president-lot-work-remaining-reach-auto-labor-deals-2023-09-13/,"Sept 13 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers on Wednesday outlined plans for a series of strikes targeting individual U.S. auto plants in what would be its first-ever simultaneous strike against the Detroit Three automakers if agreements are not reached by late Thursday. ""To win, we're likely going to have to take action,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a Facebook Live address, adding the UAW was not planning company-wide walkouts if no deal was reached but would escalate if negotiations did not improve. ""We are preparing to strike these companies in a way they have never seen before."", Fain said the Detroit Three automakers had offered 146,000 U.S. autoworkers pay raises of as much as 20% over four and a half years but called the hikes inadequate even as automakers protested the union had yet to formally respond to their latest more generous offers. Fain outlined a strategy to ""create confusion"" with a series of work stoppages targeting individual U.S. plants if no deal is reached but did not disclose which plants it planned to strike. ""We're going to hit where we need to hit,"" Fain said. Coordinated strikes would mark the first-ever simultaneous labor stoppage at all three Detroit automakers and one of the largest U.S. industrial labor actions in recent years. ""We're making progress ... but we're still very far apart on our key priorities,"" Fain said, adding the UAW will disclose which plants it will strike Thursday when the current four-year contracts expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time. Ford Motor (F.N) has proposed a 20% hike in pay, General Motors (GM.N) 18%, and Chrysler-parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) 17.5%, Fain said. That is less than half of the 40% pay hikes the union has sought, including an immediate 20% hike on ratification of a contract and 5% annual hikes, but higher than the initial offers the companies made. Ford said it had made four counteroffers and blasted the UAW saying the company had ""not received any genuine counteroffers from the union"" and added ""we should be working creatively to solve hard problems rather than planning strikes and PR events."" Stellantis said it is ""still awaiting the UAW’s response to the offer we presented yesterday."" GM said it continues ""to bargain directly and in good faith with the UAW and have presented additional strong offers. We are making progress in key areas."" Ford warned of a grim scenario. ""The future of our industry is at stake. Let’s do everything we can to avert a disastrous outcome."" The union's demands include restoring defined benefit pensions for all workers, 32-hour work weeks and additional cost-of-living hikes, as well as job security guarantees and an end to the use of temporary workers. Fain said automakers had rejected pension, 32-hour work week and other benefits. He also criticized proposed changes to profit sharing that would cut payments to workers. A UAW strike that shuts the Detroit Three manufacturers for 10 days could cost carmakers, suppliers and workers over $5 billion, Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group estimated, and could lead to a disruption of the broader auto supplier network. U.S. President Joe Biden has encouraged the parties to stay at the table ""to get a win-win agreement that keeps UAW workers at the heart of our auto future,"" White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein said Wednesday. Biden called top executives from all three automakers last week to ""encourage them to provide more forward-leaning offers to stay at the table,"" Bernstein added. AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler told Reuters autoworkers do not want to go on strike ""but they will if they have to in order to reach a fair deal."" Shuler noted there have been over 200 strikes this year in the United States. ""It's because the economy is broken. Workers are fed up,"" she said. The UAW said it is planning a rally in Detroit Friday that will include Fain, Senator Bernie Sanders and other members of Congress that would coincide with a first of day of walkouts. Targeting strategic plants could quickly force automakers to halt some or all U.S. production and could extend the time before the UAW's $825 million strike fund is exhausted.

"Biden wants UAW, automakers to work around-the-clock to avert strike",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-wants-uaw-automakers-work-around-the-clock-avert-strike-2023-09-13/,"WASHINGTON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden wants auto union UAW and major automakers to work around-the-clock to avoid a strike, White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein said Wednesday. Biden has “encouraged the parties to stay at the table and to work 24 and 7 to get a win-win agreement that keeps UAW workers at the heart of our auto future,"" Bernstein said. Asked whether Biden will bring in negotiators or be more actively involved, Bernstein said “the president’s been very much engaged.” Biden has met the UAW president in the Oval Office, called him on Labor Day, and called executives from all three automakers before he left for the G20 last week to “encourage them to provide more forward leaning offers to stay at the table.”"
Detroit UAW workers strike threat tests Biden's plan to win union votes,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/detroit-uaw-workers-strike-threat-tests-bidens-plan-win-union-votes-2023-09-06/,"WASHINGTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's strategy of backing politically crucial unions while avoiding strikes that cripple the economy has hit a bump in Detroit. During a summer of labor unrest, Biden has touted his pro-labor policies by speaking out for unions, while his administration behind the scenes tries to smooth the way for deals with employers to avoid costly walkouts, union leaders and administration officials said. But in a reminder of how hard it is to appease energized workers while tamping down on price hikes that cause inflation, Biden and auto workers union UAW - the only major union not to endorse his 2024 presidential run - are at loggerheads. Biden's Labor Day prediction that the union would not strike against Detroit's automakers ahead of a Sept. 14 contract deadline was soundly rejected by UAW President Shawn Fain. ""He must know something we don't know,"" said Fain in response, adding that he was ""shocked"" by the comment. ""Maybe the companies plan on walking in and giving us our demands on the night before. I don't know, but he's on the inside on something I don't know about."" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden's comments about the UAW over Labor Day was him being ""an optimistic person."" The president remains ""optimistic"" about a resolution of negotiations with the UAW, she said on Tuesday, and believes the union is at the ""heart of an electric vehicle future that is Made in America with union jobs."" Labor unions like the UAW - which represents 146,000 workers at General Motors, Ford and Stellantis NV's North American unit who are demanding cost of living increases and pay that matches company profits - are key to Biden's game plan for winning reelection in 2024. He needs their support to win key states like Pennsylvania and Michigan again, which stand to bear the brunt of any major strikes against carmakers. A UAW strike that shuts Detroit's Big Three manufacturers could cost carmakers, suppliers and workers over $5 billion, a study by the Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group says. With new car inventories slim, consumer experts say that could translate to higher car prices - an important component of inflation. Biden is ""more pro-labor than any other president but he is doing a balancing act when it comes to strikes,"" said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University's School of Industry & Labor Relations (ILR). Biden created a White House team in 2021 to support new unions, which his administration says are key to fighting U.S. inequality, and has backed collective bargaining and union wage increases since taking office. The White House has tried to play a role in several recent large-scale union contract negotiations involving rail workers and West Coast port workers. On Wednesday, Biden reiterated that ""collective bargaining means everyone wins,"" and said the successful negotiations to resolve a labor dispute at West Coast ports will have a direct impact on lowering inflation. Workers there ratified a new six-year contract last month that includes a 32% pay raise. While other major labor unions have endorsed Biden's 2024 run, the UAW, which backed Biden in 2020, has held out, citing his electric vehicle policies. Biden's Republican rival, Donald Trump, stepped up his attacks on the Democrat's EV policies over the Labor Day weekend, urging auto workers to support him. Trump won Michigan in 2016, helping propel him to the White House; Biden beat him by 154,000 votes in Michigan in 2020. The UAW failing to endorse Biden is ""a bit of a danger signal,"" given Michigan's importance in 2024, said Harley Shaiken, labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The hesitancy to endorse Biden, Shaiken said, ""could convince many UAW members, 'Well, if the leadership doesn't think they're so great, why not Trump?'"" SEASON OF STRIKES The labor tensions in Detroit come as unionized workers across a wide range of industries are striking, or threatening to strike, to win back concessions made during the pandemic. In 2022, there were 23 large strikes in the U.S. involving 1,000 workers or more, affecting over 120,000 workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2023, the data through August shows 34 similar work stoppages affecting over 142,000 workers. Around half a million more threatened strikes in the first half of 2023, estimates from national labor unions show. Biden, 80, is tying his 2024 re-election bid to the health of the economy, highlighting job growth, rising wages and fading recession fears. At the same time, the Biden campaign is seeking donations from corporations and executives, and endorsement from business for its economic policies. Accelerating Detroit's shift to electric vehicles is a central element of Biden's climate policy, and the administration is offering billions of dollars in federal subsidies to spur domestic EV and battery production. UAW members in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and other Midwestern states, however, mainly build combustion trucks and SUVs. The president has directed his staff to engage in ""prudent policymaking,"" over labor issues, two senior White House officials said in late July, indicating that the White House will not jump into every high-profile negotiation. They said they are in constant touch with unions and employers, monitoring the progress in talks. ""We don't view our role as waiting for more opportunities to jump in and facilitate,"" one of the officials said. The White House last week announced $12 billion in Energy Department grants and loans that automakers could use to retool factories to build electric vehicles, a nod to the UAW's push to stop Stellantis from closing a Jeep assembly plant in Belvidere, Illinois. The company blamed the decision to idle the plant on the high cost of converting to electric vehicles. That is a contrast from direct mediation by administration officials last year in an agreement to prevent a national rail strike that could have devastated the American economy. Biden's intervention provoked criticism from some workers and labor allies, who blamed the administration for undercutting their negotiating position. That dynamic is why the Teamsters, representing UPS workers, urged the White House to stay out of its talks at a critical phase in July - as it ultimately did, labor experts said."
UAW makes contract counteroffer to Ford; Stellantis to make offer,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-plans-make-contract-counteroffer-ford-source-2023-09-06/,"Sept 6 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union on Wednesday made a labor contract counterproposal on economic issues to Ford Motor (F.N), while Chrysler parent company Stellantis (STLAM.MI) planned its counteroffer this week. Talks are heating up ahead of the expiration on Sept. 14 of the current four-year labor agreements covering 146,000 workers at the Detroit Three automakers. The UAW has said 97% of members voted in favor of authorizing a strike if agreement is not reached. ""They chose to follow the same path they have in the past, which is delay, delay,"" UAW President Shawn Fain told CNBC Wednesday night. ""They waited now until the last eight days to want to start talking -- so we've got a lot of work to do."" Last week, Ford said it had offered a 9% wage increase through 2027, much less than the 46% wage hike being sought by the union. The UAW expects to receive a proposal from General Motors (GM.N) on Thursday, a source told Reuters, who spoke on condition of anonymity. GM confirmed it will meet with the UAW Thursday but declined to provide any details. Stellantis said on Wednesday it intends to give the UAW a counter offer on the union's economic demands by the end of the week. Ford said Wednesday it continues to negotiate with the UAW but declined comment on details of the talks. Last week, the UAW filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board against GM and Chrysler-parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI), saying they refused to bargain in good faith. The union's demands include a 20% immediate wage increase followed by four 5% annual wage hikes, defined-benefit pensions for all workers, 32-hour work weeks and additional cost of living hikes. The UAW also wants all temporary workers at U.S. automakers to be made permanent, enhanced profit sharing and the restoration of retiree health-care benefits and cost-of-living adjustments. The UAW said Ford wants no cap on temporary workers and that those workers would not participate in profit sharing, would earn less than 60% of the top wage rate for permanent workers and receive inferior health-care benefits. Ford said it would boost starting pay for temporary workers to $20 an hour, up 20%, and offer permanent employees $12,000 in cost-of-living adjustments over the contract. The UAW said Ford's profit-sharing formula change would have cut payouts by 21% over the last two years, while Ford said it was offering a $5,500 signing bonus upon the contract's ratification for permanent and temporary workers."
Tesla pushes US appeals court to uphold ban on workers' union t-shirts,https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/tesla-pushes-us-appeals-court-uphold-ban-workers-union-t-shirts-2023-09-06/,"Sept 6 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court panel on Wednesday seemed open to reversing a labor board's ruling that Tesla Inc violated the rights of factory workers by barring them from wearing t-shirts supporting a union campaign. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in New Orleans repeatedly questioned lawyers for Tesla, the National Labor Relations Board and the United Auto Workers union (UAW) about whether the fact that Tesla still allowed workers to wear union stickers was enough to uphold its uniform policy. The NLRB last year said the policy requiring workers at factories in California and Nevada to wear black shirts with Tesla logos was illegal because there were no ""special circumstances"" warranting restrictions on union attire. Tesla adopted the policy in 2017 amid a campaign by the UAW to organize production workers. The union has accused Tesla of various unlawful tactics to stifle organizing, which the company has denied. During oral arguments on Wednesday, the 5th Circuit judges suggested that Tesla may not have been required to prove special circumstances justifying its uniform policy, such as public image or safety concerns, because it only prohibited t-shirts and not all union insignia. ""A sticker says 'go union,' 'union is good' or whatever. In what way is that an insufficient means of communication?"" Circuit Judge Jerry Smith asked Micah Jost, who represented the NLRB. Circuit Judge Stephen Higginson similarly suggested that the ban in federal labor law on prohibiting union insignia did not mean employers must allow all union-related apparel. ""If you have uniforms, you have to let them still express themselves through some sort of item attachment, and (Tesla) would say they're doing that and the record suggests that they are,"" Higginson said. Jost said Tesla's policy did not explicitly allow union items to be worn along with company t-shirts and that the stickers some Tesla workers wore were small and had less of an impact than a union t-shirt. Michael Kenneally of Morgan Lewis & Bockius, who represents Tesla, told the court that if the board's decision is upheld it would mean that company uniform policies that have been common for decades would be illegal unless employers can justify them. Echoing the judges, Kenneally pointed out that Tesla's policy provided for alternative means for workers to convey union messages, such as the stickers. “There hasn’t been a meaningful infringement on employees’ ability to communicate their support for the union,” Kenneally said. The panel also included Circuit Judge Leslie Southwick. The full, or en banc, 5th Circuit is separately considering Tesla's appeal of an NLRB decision that said CEO Elon Musk violated federal labor law by tweeting in 2018 that employees would lose stock options if they joined a union. A three-judge 5th Circuit panel in March had affirmed the board's decision. The case is Tesla v. NLRB, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 22-60493.

Lessor AerCap agrees settlement over Aeroflot jets stranded in Russia,https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/aircraft-lessor-aercap-settles-russia-aeroflot-claim-645-million-2023-09-06/,"DUBLIN, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The world's largest aircraft lessor has agreed to settle an insurance claim over Russia's refusal to return 17 jets leased to airline Aeroflot, a landmark agreement in a dispute over 400 Western planes stranded in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. Ireland-based AerCap (AER.N) in a stock market filing said it had received $645 million from insurance company NSK in full settlement of insurance claims in relation to 17 aircraft and five spare engines leased to state-controlled airline Aeroflot and its subsidiary Rossiya. The planes would now become the property of Russian state-owned NSK. ""We have released our claims against NSK, Aeroflot, Rossiya and their international reinsurers with respect to these aircraft and engines,"" said AerCap, whose shares rose around 5% in premarket trading. Before last year's invasion of Ukraine, Russia was a major market for aircraft lessors, which bought jets from Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA) and leased them to Russian airlines. The invasion triggered Western sanctions that forced lessors to cancel hundreds of leases. Moscow then refused to allow the planes to leave. Aeroflot said in a statement that ownership of 18 aircraft and five engines had transferred to NSK following settlement with AerCap. It was not immediately clear why the number of aircraft differed from AerCap's statement by one. ""AerCap has terminated its claims against Russian parties both under insurance policies issued by Russian insurance companies and under leasing agreements,"" Aeroflot said, adding that it is in talks with other lessors about settling claims. AerCap said it had secured permission from the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments to complete the deal, which it said was ""consistent with other applicable sanctions regimes."" EU sanctions do not prohibit such insurance settlements with Russian entities, depending on the details of the deal, lawyers say. The deal, an apparent compromise in an economic war between Moscow and the West, looks set to lower a bill facing insurers, who are locked in court cases over who should pay for the loss of up to $10 billion. AerCap filed a $3.5 billion London lawsuit last year against AIG and Lloyd's over 141 aircraft and 29 aircraft engines it owned that were on lease to Russian airlines. A number of smaller lessors also have jets stuck in Russia, including SMBC Aviation Capital, which had 34. AerCap said the amount of its claim against its all-risks insurers under ""our contingent and possessed insurance policy"" has been reduced to approximately $2.75 billion following the Aeroflot settlement. It was not immediately clear whether such settlements could also allow Russian airlines to secure more formal ownership of planes at potentially steep discounts. AerCap said settlement discussions were ongoing with respect to claims under the insurance policies of several other Russian airlines. Reuters reported last year that Russian airlines had held exploratory talks with at least one major Western leasing firm about using state funds to buy some of the stranded jets. AerCap in March said it had been approached by Russian airlines and their insurance companies about possible settlements for the stranded planes."

Lordstown Motors, named for the Ohio town where it is based, filed a Chapter 11 plan Friday in Delaware bankruptcy court, outlining how it intends to distribute proceeds from an ongoing effort to sell its assets. Lordstown's Chapter 11 plan warned that the value of its assets is ""necessarily speculative"" at this stage in the bankruptcy and ""could potentially be zero."" Lordstown has set a Sept. 8 deadline for bids, with a Sept. 19 auction to follow. The company's shareholders would only be paid after its creditors and Lordstown's Chapter 11 plan did not include an estimate of how much creditors are owed. Lordstown reported in earlier court filings that it owed about $20 million to 30 trade vendors, and recently agreed to pay $40 million to settle a trade secrets lawsuit filed by rival automaker Karma. Even if the sale generates enough money for a shareholder payout, Lordstown proposed to pay nothing to the 300,000 preferred equity shares held by its estranged former business partner Foxconn. A lawyer for Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW) and best known for assembling Apple's (AAPL.O) iPhones, purchased Lordstown's manufacturing facility as part of its push into the electric vehicle market. Lordstown sued Foxconn for failing to honor an agreement to invest $170 million in its electric truck business, and for engaging in a pattern of delays that undermined Lordstown's operations, as part of its bankruptcy filing in June. Lordstown alleged that Foxconn purchased only $30 million of the $100 million in preferred equity shares contemplated by the disputed investment agreement. Foxconn also purchased $22.7 million of Lordstown's common shares, owning about 8.4% of the company's equity, according to court documents. Foxconn has disputed Lordstown's ""flawed"" interpretation of the investment agreement in its bankruptcy court filings, saying that it had ""rightfully refused to fund additional capital into Lordstown's failing business."" Foxconn had asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to dismiss Lordstown's bankruptcy, a request that the judge denied on Aug. 28. Lordstown, once valued at $5.3 billion, manufactured just 80 electric trucks before shutting down its operations."

Both executives reiterated they want to reach a ""fair"" agreement without a strike. The executives did not detail GM's economic proposals to the UAW."
Biden takes shot at Trump on jobs in battleground Pennsylvania,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-takes-economic-pitch-battleground-pennsylvania-us-labor-day-2023-09-04/,"PHILADELPHIA, Sept 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday took shots at his likely 2024 rival, Donald Trump, in a Labor Day speech aimed at shoring up support in Pennsylvania, a state he needs to win next year to retain the White House. A self-described champion of labor unions, Biden addressed union workers in Philadelphia as he sought to explain his economic policies to a public worried about the economy, despite easing inflation and low unemployment levels. ""It wasn't that long ago we were losing jobs in this country,"" Biden said ahead of a parade marking the U.S. Labor Day holiday. ""In fact, the guy who held this job before me was just one of two presidents in history who left office with fewer jobs in America than when he got elected."" U.S. unemployment fell after Trump took office as president in January 2017, and the jobs market saw robust growth during much of his administration. But unemployment rose sharply toward the end of Trump's term in a pandemic-driven economic downturn. Since January 2021, job growth has averaged 436,000 per month and now the U.S. is 4 million jobs above the pre-pandemic peak. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement that Biden was “the destroyer of American jobs and continues to fuel runaway inflation with reckless, big government spending” and that Trump had produced a “booming economic recovery” while in office. Biden earlier in the day weighed in on the tensions between the United Auto Workers union and the Detroit Three automakers, telling reporters he thought it was unlikely the UAW would strike when its current contract expires on Sept. 15. That drew a response from union leadership, after the National Labor Relations board said on Friday it would investigate UAW claims that General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) were not bargaining in good faith, assertions that the automakers deny. ""I appreciate the president's optimism and I also hope that the Big Three will come to their senses and start bargaining in good faith, but we are ready to do what is necessary come Sept. 15 if they don't,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. Economic issues are likely to play a critical role in the 2024 presidential race, a likely rematch between Biden, a Democrat, and Republican former President Trump. Rebuilding crumbling infrastructure has been a part of Biden's pitch to voters, with a $1 trillion infrastructure law pumping money into projects built with union labor. Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states that are seen as politically competitive and likely to determine who wins the White House in 2024. The others most competitive states are Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last month showed that the economy, unemployment and jobs remained Americans' top concern. A full 60% of Americans, including one in three Democrats, said they disapproved of Biden's handling of inflation, according to the poll. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge has moved down to 3.3%, from its peak of 7% last summer. Although the decline was a ""welcome development,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said late last month, inflation ""remains too high"" and interest rates may need to move higher. Republicans and some economists say Democratic policies helped spark the rise in prices, making Americans pay more for rent, groceries and gasoline under Biden's watch. Economists say inflation was also stoked by the lifting of COVID-era restrictions and revival of business activity that followed."
"Volkswagen's family ownership not behind share price trough, Wolfgang Porsche says",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagens-family-ownership-not-behind-share-price-trough-wolfgang-porsche-2023-09-04/,"MUNICH, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) languishing share price, which is near a three-and-a-half year low, is not the result of ownership control by the Porsche and Piech families, one of its most powerful members said on Monday. Wolfgang Porsche, the grandson of Ferdinand Porsche who founded the sportscar manufacturer that still bears his name, called on Europe's top carmaker to cut more costs and become more efficient. Volkswagen's low valuation, which some investors trace back to Volkswagen's ownership structure related corporate governance issues, has been a long-standing problem that even the landmark listing of its Porsche AG (P911_p.DE) division last year has failed to solve. ""The major shareholders are certainly not the reason for the poor valuation of the share,"" Wolfgang Porsche, who leads the supervisory boards of both Porsche SE (PSHG_p.DE) and Porsche AG, told Reuters on the sidelines of the IAA car show in Munich. The Porsche and Piech families essentially control Volkswagen via their holding firm Porsche SE, which holds most of the voting rights in the Wolfsburg-based carmaker. ""We have to get an even better grip on performance and costs,"" Porsche, 80, said, adding Volkswagen had to become more competitive. ""Everything has to be considered."" With a view to its competitors, the group could not assume that it would be able to avoid cutting costs, Porsche, who also sits on Volkswagen's supervisory board, said. Porsche also brushed aside investor criticism about the dual role of Oliver Blume, who, as chief executive of both Volkswagen and Porsche AG, serves as the leader of two blue-chip companies, which has stoked concerns among corporate governance specialists. ""Oliver Blume hasn't been there that long, and he runs two DAX companies. And he does it very well."" Regarding the families' closely-watched succession planning, Porsche said that his nephew, Ferdinand Oliver Porsche, who also sits on the supervisory boards of Volkswagen, Porsche SE and Porsche AG, was a natural future successor were he to step down. ""He has been in all the relevant committees for many years,"" Porsche said of him, adding he was experienced enough. ""I certainly won't do this forever."""

""I'm not worried about a strike,"" the Democratic president said on Monday as he arrived in Philadelphia ahead of a speech for the U.S. Labor Day holiday. ""I don't think it's going to happen."" Late last month, the United Auto Workers union said its members voted overwhelmingly in favor of authorizing a strike at the Detroit Three automakers if agreement is not reached before the current four-year contract expires on Sept. 14.

Stellantis said it was shocked by the UAW claims ""that we have not bargained in good faith. This is a claim with no basis in fact."" Stellantis also said it was disappointed that Fain ""is more focused on filing frivolous legal charges than on actual bargaining."" GM manufacturing chief Gerald Johnson said the company strongly refuted the unfair labor charge. ""We believe it has no merit and is an insult to the bargaining committees.

The UAW also wants all temporary workers at U.S. automakers to be made permanent, enhanced profit sharing, substantial increase in paid time off, and the restoration of retiree health-care benefits and cost-of-living adjustments. The UAW said Ford wants no cap on temporary workers and that those workers would not participate in profit sharing, would earn less than 60% of the top wage rate for permanent workers and receive inferior health-care benefits. Ford said it would boost starting pay for temporary workers to $20 an hour, up 20%, and offer permanent employees $12,000 in cost-of-living adjustments over the contract. Ford said only 2-3% of Ford’s hourly workforce are temporary employees, the lowest among the Detroit Three. The UAW said Ford's profit-sharing formula change would have cut payouts by 21% over the last two years, while Ford said it was offering a $5,500 signing bonus upon the contract's ratification for permanent and temporary workers."

"Tesla faces federal probe over vehicle range after Reuters report, Wall Street Journal says",https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-faces-federal-probes-over-secret-musk-house-project-wsj-2023-08-30/,"Aug 30 (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are looking into Tesla (TSLA.O) performance claims after Reuters reported the electric carmaker exaggerated the potential driving distance of its vehicles, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Reuters reported in July that Tesla cars often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and projections reported by the cars' own equipment, citing experts who tested or studied them. The company wrote algorithms about a decade ago to create ""rosy"" in-dash driving range estimates, Reuters reported a source as saying, and set up a ""Diversion Team"" to cancel range-related service appointments. The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter. Tesla faces many probes, including federal auto safety regulators looking at its Autopilot driver assistance product. The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan also is investigating Tesla's use of company funds on a secret project described internally as a house for Chief Executive Elon Musk, the Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for the federal prosecutors' office declined to comment on the Journal report on the probes. Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. No dollar figures were disclosed regarding the probe of the house, which the newspaper said was near Austin, Texas. The Journal reported in July that Tesla board members had investigated whether company resources were misused on the effort. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has also opened a civil probe, the Journal reported. An SEC spokesperson said the agency does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation. The probes are in their early stages and may not lead to charges, the Journal said. Prosecutors focused on the house project were seeking information about personal benefits to Musk, the world's richest man, as well as how much Tesla spent on the project and what it was for, the Journal reported."

Pilots at several airlines including American Airlines (AAL.O), Delta Airlines (DAL.N), United Airlines Holdings (UAL.O), Spirit Airlines (SAVE.N), Jetblue Airways (JBLU.O) negotiated new job contracts this year. Members of some unions like the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association have voted to authorize a strike if a new contract is not reached. Spirit AeroSystems (SPR.N) negotiated a new contract to end a strike that led to a week-long work stoppage at its plant in Wichita, Kansas.

Toyota to restart Japan production on Wednesday after system failure,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-halts-operations-12-japan-factories-due-system-failure-nhk-2023-08-29/,"TOKYO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor (7203.T) will restart operations at its assembly plants in Japan on Wednesday, after a production system malfunction brought domestic output to a halt at the world's biggest-selling automaker. Toyota will resume operations at 25 production lines of a dozen plants in its home market from Wednesday morning and add the final two plants from the afternoon, it said. The company continues to investigate the cause of the glitch, which it said was not due to a cyberattack and prevented it from ordering components. The plants together account for about a third of the automaker's global production, Reuters calculations showed. Toyota's domestic production had been on the rebound after a series of output cuts it blamed on semiconductor shortages. Output was up 29% in January-June, the first such increase in two years. ​ Its Japan output averaged about 13,500 vehicles daily in the first half of the year, Reuters calculations showed. That excludes vehicles from group automakers Daihatsu and Hino. Operations were halted for a day last year when a supplier suffered a cyberattack, hampering Toyota's ability to order parts. Toyota resumed operations using a back-up network. Analysts said Toyota could be tested in making up for output lost during the outage, such as by running extra shifts. ""Output was running at full capacity so there's little additional room for production,"" said Seiji Sugiura, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute. Tuesday's incident also had a knock-on effect. Group firm Toyota Industries (6201.T) said it has partially suspended operations at two engine plants due to the automaker's glitch. Toyota is a pioneer of just-in-time inventory management, which keeps down costs but means supply chain snarls put production at risk. While the cause of the latest malfunction was unclear, corporate Japan has been on alert in recent days as businesses and government offices reported harassing phone calls. The government said the calls were likely from China and related to Japan's release of treated radioactive water from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean. Toyota's share price closed down 0.21% at 2,431.5 yen after spending much of the morning deeper in negative territory."

On Monday, the 44,000-strong union won permission to go on a strike from a government organisation that handles labour disputes, raising the probability of the company's first wage-related industrial action in five years. Union members unanimously voted to restart negotiations after a company request, the union said in a statement, adding that talks will resume on Thursday. However, the union said unionised workers would skip extra shifts from Sept. 4, while negotiations were underway. In a fast-ageing society, South Korean labour unions including one at Hyundai, the country's top automaker, are battling company managements to press an unusual demand: raise the age of retirement to give workers a few more wage-earning years to make up for slim pensions."

The S&P 500 logged its strongest one-day gain since June 2, while the Nasdaq notched its strongest session since July 28, and both indexes closed at more than two-week highs. The sharp gains came after the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed the number of job openings stood at 8.827 million in July, falling for the third straight month and signaling easing labor market pressures. Investors also parsed a report from the Conference Board showing consumer confidence in the United States fell to 106.1 in August, compared with expectations of 116. Interest rate futures signaled an 87% chance the Fed will keep rates steady at its September meeting and a 54% chance it will keep rates on hold through November, according the CME Group's FedWatch tool. ""Investors are of the mindset that 'You know what, maybe interest rate hikes are indeed behind us. So let's buy back into stocks,'"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note eased to 4.11%, while that on the two-year note fell back below 5% after hovering around that level for the past few sessions. The decline in yields supported growth stocks, with Nvidia (NVDA.O) climbing 4.2% to close at its highest ever. Tesla (TSLA.O) rallied 7.7%, even after documents showed a U.S. regulator sent a special order to the electric vehicle maker asking questions about changes to the driver monitoring system for its Autopilot software. Nvidia and Tesla led in turnover on Wall Street, with over $33 billion traded in each stock. Alphabet (GOOGL.O) received a 2.7% boost from a swath of fresh artificial-intelligence technology and partnerships unveiled by the Google-parent. The S&P 500 climbed 1.45% to end the session at 4,497.63 points. The Nasdaq gained 1.74% to 13,943.76 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.85% to 34,852.67 points. Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 10.0 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 10.7 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions. All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by communication services (.SPLRCL), up 2.46%, followed by a 2.35% gain in consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD). The July non-farm payrolls report on Friday will offer investors more clarity about the state of the labor market. Focus will also be on the personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, which is due on Thursday. Lack of hawkish surprises in Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments at the Jackson Hole symposium last week buoyed stocks on Monday, with the focus now on the upcoming economic data to gauge how long the central bank could keep interest rates elevated. Catalent (CTLT.N) jumped almost 5% after the contract drugmaker reached a settlement with activist investor Elliott Investment Management to conduct a review. Verizon (VZ.N) and AT&T (T.N) each gained more than 3% after Citi upgraded the telecom companies to ""buy"" from ""neutral"". U.S.-listed shares of PDD Holdings (PDD.O) rallied over 15% after the Chinese e-commerce firm beat second-quarter revenue estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 (.AD.SPX) by a 8.2-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 21 new highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 52 new highs and 115 new lows."
Tesla's Autopilot faces unprecedented scrutiny,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-autopilot-faces-unprecedented-scrutiny-2022-11-01/,"Aug 29 (Reuters) - Elon Musk has championed Tesla Inc's (TSLA.O) driver assistance Autopilot and ""Full Self-Driving"" software as innovations that will both improve road safety and position the electric vehicle maker as a technology leader. But the Tesla systems - and Musk's claims about them - face their biggest challenge since the launch of Autopilot in 2015 as a series of lawsuits over fatal Tesla accidents head to court starting next month and a federal probe into Autopilot nears an end. Here is a list of legal and regulatory challenges to Autopilot: The U.S. auto safety regulator investigating Tesla's Autopilot is demanding an explanation for a software change that allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel for longer, risking collisions, documents released on Tuesday showed. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been probing the performance and safety of Autopilot after identifying more than a dozen crashes in which Tesla vehicles hit stationary emergency vehicles. It is investigating whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure drivers are paying attention when using the driver assistance system. In June 2022, NHTSA upgraded an earlier probe of 830,000 Tesla vehicles into an engineering analysis - a required step before it could potentially demand a recall. The agency's acting head Ann Carlson told Reuters Aug. 25 that a resolution of the Autopilot investigation will come soon. Tesla is under criminal investigation in the United States over claims that the company's electric vehicles can drive themselves, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters last year. The Justice Department investigation potentially could conclude with criminal charges against the company or individual executives, the people familiar with the inquiry said. In July, Tesla said in a securities filing that ""the company has received requests from the DOJ for documents related to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD features."" Last year, California's transportation regulator accused Tesla of ""deceptive practice"" of advertising suggesting its driver assistance technology provided autonomous vehicle control. California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) could suspend Tesla's license to sell vehicles in California and require the company to make restitution to drivers. California's DMV is also conducting a separate safety review which could force Tesla to seek regulatory permits to operate its vehicles in California. Tesla faces two trials over fatal Autopilot accidents in quick succession, with more to follow. The first, scheduled for mid-September in a California state court, is a civil lawsuit containing allegations that the Autopilot system caused owner Micah Lee’s Model 3 to suddenly veer off a highway east of Los Angeles at 65 mph (105 kph), strike a palm tree and burst into flames, all in the span of seconds, in 2019. The second trial, set to go to trial in October, arose out of an accident that killed the 50-year-old Tesla Model 3 owner Jeremy Banner when his car struck a tractor trailer at the intersection of a highway in Florida in 2019. A 2018 crash involving a Tesla Model X killed the driver, Apple engineer Walter Huang, when it swerved and slammed into a concrete divider on a freeway in Mountain View, California. A lawsuit by his wife against Tesla is scheduled to go to trial next year. The National Transportation Safety Board investigated both the California and Florida accidents and blamed both the driver and Tesla. The NTSB said drivers relied too heavily on the Autopilot system, while Tesla failed to restrict the use of Autopilot or to adequately monitor driver attentiveness. Tesla said the drivers' hands in both accidents were not detected on the wheel for several seconds prior to the collision, and that they did not take action to avoid the accident. In September, Tesla was sued in a proposed class action accusing the EV maker and Musk of having deceptively advertised Autopilot and FSD as fully functioning or ""just around the corner."" The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco said Tesla did this to ""generate excitement"" about its vehicles, drive up its stock price and become a ""dominant player"" in EVs. Tesla did not respond to questions from Reuters about the lawsuits and investigations mentioned above."
Canadian union Unifor names Ford as bargaining target among Detroit Three,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/canadian-union-unifor-names-ford-bargaining-target-among-detroit-three-2023-08-29/,"Aug 29 (Reuters) - Canadian union Unifor on Tuesday announced Ford Motor (F.N) as its potential target for negotiations amid contract talks with the Detroit Three automakers. Unifor and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union's members at the Detroit Three automakers have voted in favor of a strike authorization if an agreement is not reached before the current contract expires. The Canadian operations of the Detroit Three are much smaller than their U.S. operations. But the automakers all have critical factories in Canada. Unifor President Lana Payne noted that Ford's Windsor, Ontario engine plant, which her union represents, builds engine for some of the company's most profitable trucks. Unifor's choice could be a boost for Ford, giving the automaker an opportunity to tailor terms of the agreement to its advantage. ""We have maintained open communication with the UAW ... but we have our own priorities in Canada,"" Payne told a press conference. The UAW, which represents about 150,000 workers at the Detroit Three's U.S. factories, has not yet chosen one company to lead contract talks. UAW President Shawn Fain has said all the three companies - Ford, General Motors (GM.N) and Stellantis NV - need to conclude new contracts by a Sept. 14 deadline. Unifor, which represents 18,000 members at Ford, GM and Stellantis in Canada, had opened formal negotiations with the three companies on Aug. 10 in Toronto."
India's Maruti Suzuki reaffirms production goals; names new CFO,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/maruti-suzuki-india-plans-add-production-capacity-2-mln-cars-over-8-years-2023-08-29/,"BENGALURU, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Maruti Suzuki India (MRTI.NS) on Tuesday reiterated plans to double its production capacity to 4 million cars that would need an investment of at least 450 billion rupees ($5.4 billion) in the next eight years. The cost of doubling the production capacity might exceed depending on inflation, Chairman R.C. Bhargava said at the company's annual general meeting. Bhargava added he will take up stock split talks with the board as sought by some investors. India's top automaker by sales also expects export volumes to grow to 800,000 cars by fiscal 2031. As of fiscal 2023, it exported 259,333 cars. Additionally, the company named Schneider Electric executive Arnab Roy as chief financial officer, effective Jan. 1, 2024. Roy will replace Ajay Seth, who is retiring on Dec. 31 after serving as the CFO since 2005. Seth will remain a member of the executive board. Most recently, Roy served as the zone CFO for Schneider's India businesses, which focuses on making and servicing tech products used for electricity distribution. ""This event of change in the CFO is not going to impact the company. The transition is going to be smooth. We see this as a neutral or no-event for the stock,"" said Amit Hiranandani, the automobile sector lead analyst at brokerage firm SMIFS Ltd. Maruti in July reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on strong orders and forecast a rise in average selling prices in subsequent quarters. Earlier this month, the automaker said it would buy its Japanese parent Suzuki Motor's (7269.T) plant in Gujarat. It plans to roll out six electric vehicles by 2030, each of which will be produced at the Gujarat plant. India is working on an EV policy that would cut import taxes for automakers that commit to some local manufacturing. Maruti's shares closed up 0.3%. ($1 = 82.6907 Indian rupees)"
Labour unions push to raise retirement age in greying South Korea,https://www.reuters.com/business/labour-unions-push-raise-retirement-age-greying-south-korea-2023-08-29/,"SEOUL, Aug 29 (Reuters) - South Korean labour unions are battling company managements to press an unusual demand: raising the age of retirement to give workers a few more wage-earning years before having to seek another job to supplement slim pensions. The issue fuels a contest for jobs between older workers among one of the world's fastest-ageing populations, with a rate of poverty among its elderly of three times the OECD average, and young workforce entrants facing dwindling options. ""Having to move to low-quality jobs after retirement is perpetuating unstable labour for people in their 60s,"" one of the two largest umbrella unions, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU), said in a statement. With South Korea expected to become a ""super-ageing"" society in 2025, as more than a fifth of its population passes 65, demands to extend the retirement age are growing. But detractors say the change would worsen job prospects for the young, and hobble companies from adapting to a changing environment. ""If the retirement age is simply extended by law, as the labour community insists, it can be a great barrier and despair for young people who want to find a job,"" the presidential Economic, Social and Labor Council said this month. The labour union at steelmaker POSCO, a unit of POSCO Holdings (005490.KS), plans to hold a vote on whether to call a strike, a union official said on Tuesday, after failing to strike a deal with management over wages. Raising the retirement age by a year from 60 was one of the demands made by the 11,000-member union in the first failed wage negotiation in the 55 years since the steelmaker was founded. POSCO has called for the union to return to the talks. Set to unveil plans for possible strike action on Wednesday is the 44,000-strong Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) union, which is also demanding extension of the retirement age, this time to 64 from 60. The moves come after the FKTU umbrella union launched a petition this year for parliament to gradually raise the legal retirement age to 65. While South Korean law sets a retirement age of 60 or higher, most companies have fixed it at 60, the lowest possible. But the National Pension Service (NPS) only begins paying out at age 63 to 65, depending on dates of birth, and the pension only replaces a fraction of wages. South Koreans aged 65 or older form 18.4% of the population, up from 11.9% in 2013 and are projected to exceed 20% in 2025 and 40% in 2050, Statistics Korea says. The NPS, struggling to support the fast-ageing population, is expected to see its wage replacement rate fall to 40% in 2028 from 70% in 1998. That compares with a threshold of about 60 to 70% in advanced European economies. The average rate of poverty among the elderly stood at 13.1% in nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by 2018, compared to 43.4% for South Korea. Although the NPS is the world's third-largest pension fund, managing 974 trillion won ($737 billion) by May, it is expected to run out of cash by 2055. And there is rising demand for the jobs the union members want to retain. When Hyundai Motor began to recruit 400 factory workers in March, its first such exercise in a decade, high traffic volume paralysed its recruitment website on the first day. Media estimated applicants outnumbered the jobs on offer by hundreds of times, although Hyundai Motor declined to confirm the figure. Last year Kia Corp (000270.KS) drew nearly 50,000 applicants against vacancies for 100 technicians, the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper said. ""We need to raise the retirement age to ensure employment stability and appropriate wages for the elderly ... to prevent poverty in old age,"" the labour federation, FKTU, told parliament in its petition.

Focus: Tesla braces for its first trial involving Autopilot fatality,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-braces-its-first-trial-involving-autopilot-fatality-2023-08-28/,"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) is set to defend itself for the first time at trial against allegations that failure of its Autopilot driver assistant feature led to death, in what will likely be a major test of Chief Executive Elon Musk's assertions about the technology. Self-driving capability is central to Tesla’s financial future, according to Musk, whose own reputation as an engineering leader is being challenged with allegations by plaintiffs in one of two lawsuits that he personally leads the group behind technology that failed. Wins by Tesla could raise confidence and sales for the software, which costs up to $15,000 per vehicle. Tesla faces two trials in quick succession, with more to follow. The first, scheduled for mid-September in a California state court, is a civil lawsuit containing allegations that the Autopilot system caused owner Micah Lee’s Model 3 to suddenly veer off a highway east of Los Angeles at 65 miles per hour, strike a palm tree and burst into flames, all in the span of seconds. The 2019 crash, which has not been previously reported, killed Lee and seriously injured his two passengers, including a then-8-year old boy who was disemboweled. The lawsuit, filed against Tesla by the passengers and Lee's estate, accuses Tesla of knowing that Autopilot and other safety systems were defective when it sold the car. The second trial, set for early October in a Florida state court, arose out of a 2019 crash north of Miami where owner Stephen Banner’s Model 3 drove under the trailer of an 18-wheeler big rig truck that had pulled into the road, shearing off the Tesla's roof and killing Banner. Autopilot failed to brake, steer or do anything to avoid the collision, according to the lawsuit filed by Banner's wife. Tesla denied liability for both accidents, blamed driver error and said Autopilot is safe when monitored by humans. Tesla said in court documents that drivers must pay attention to the road and keep their hands on the steering wheel. ""There are no self-driving cars on the road today,"" the company said. The civil proceedings will likely reveal new evidence about what Musk and other company officials knew about Autopilot’s capabilities – and any possible deficiencies. Banner’s attorneys, for instance, argue in a pretrial court filing that internal emails show Musk is the Autopilot team's ""de facto leader"". Tesla and Musk did not respond to Reuters’ emailed questions for this article, but Musk has made no secret of his involvement in self-driving software engineering, often tweeting about his test-driving of a Tesla equipped with ""Full Self-Driving"" software. He has for years promised that Tesla would achieve self-driving capability only to miss his own targets. Tesla won a bellwether trial in Los Angeles in April with a strategy of saying that it tells drivers that its technology requires human monitoring, despite the ""Autopilot"" and ""Full Self-Driving"" names. The case was about an accident where a Model S swerved into the curb and injured its driver, and jurors told Reuters after the verdict that they believed Tesla warned drivers about its system and driver distraction was to blame. The stakes for Tesla are much higher in the September and October trials, the first of a series related to Autopilot this year and next, because people died. ""If Tesla backs up a lot of wins in these cases, I think they're going to get more favorable settlements in other cases,"" said Matthew Wansley, a former General Counsel of nuTonomy, an automated driving startup and Associate Professor of Law at Cardozo School of Law. On the other hand, ""a big loss for Tesla - especially with a big damages award"" could ""dramatically shape the narrative going forward,"" said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina. In court filings, the company has argued that Lee consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel and that it is not clear whether Autopilot was on at the time of crash. Jonathan Michaels, an attorney for the plaintiffs, declined to comment on Tesla’s specific arguments, but said ""we're fully aware of Tesla's false claims including their shameful attempts to blame the victims for their known defective autopilot system."" In the Florida case, Banner's attorneys also filed a motion arguing punitive damages were warranted. The attorneys have deposed several Tesla executives and received internal documents from the company that they said show Musk and engineers were aware of, and did not fix, shortcomings. In one deposition, former executive Christopher Moore testified there are limitations to Autopilot, saying it ""is not designed to detect every possible hazard or every possible obstacle or vehicle that could be on the road,"" according to a transcript reviewed by Reuters. In 2016, a few months after a fatal accident where a Tesla crashed into a semi-trailer truck, Musk told reporters that the automaker was updating Autopilot with improved radar sensors that likely would have prevented the fatality. But Adam (Nicklas) Gustafsson, a Tesla Autopilot systems engineer who investigated both accidents in Florida, said that in the almost three years between that 2016 crash and Banner’s accident, no changes were made to Autopilot’s systems to account for cross-traffic, according to court documents submitted by plaintiff lawyers. The lawyers tried to blame the lack of change on Musk. ""Elon Musk has acknowledged problems with the Tesla autopilot system not working properly,"" according to plaintiffs' documents. Former Autopilot engineer Richard Baverstock, who was also deposed, stated that ""almost everything"" he did at Tesla was done at the request of ""Elon,"" according to the documents. Tesla filed an emergency motion in court late on Wednesday seeking to keep deposition transcripts of its employees and other documents secret. Banner’s attorney, Lake ""Trey"" Lytal III, said he would oppose the motion. ""The great thing about our judicial system is Billion Dollar Corporations can only keep secrets for so long,"" he wrote in a text message."
UAW workers ratify Ultium Cells wage agreement in Ohio,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-workers-ratify-ultium-cells-wage-agreement-ohio-2023-08-27/,"Aug 27 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union at Ultium Cells, a joint venture of General Motors (GM.N) and LG Energy Solution (373220.KS) in Lordstown, Ohio, on Sunday said members voted in favor by 895 to 22 votes to ratify an interim agreement that immediately raises wages by $3 to $4 an hour. Earlier this week, General Motors and LG Energy Solution said they will hike the wages of workers at its Ohio plant by an average of 25% after some U.S. senators blasted the facility for paying workers as little as $16 an hour. The interim wage increase will be retroactive to December 2022 and some workers will receive between $3,000 to $7,000, based on hours worked. The companies had said workers must still ratify the interim wage increase that takes effect Aug. 28. The UAW also said negotiations for a complete first contract will continue between the union’s elected bargaining committee and Ultium Cells. UAW President Shawn Fain said the union ""will keep fighting at Ultium and all EV plants to win the same strong pay and safety standards that generations of autoworkers have won at GM, Ford (F.N) and Stellantis <STLAM.MI>."" On Friday UAW workers voted overwhelmingly in favor of authorizing a strike at the Detroit Three automakers if an agreement is not reached before the current four-year contract expires on Sept. 14."

The National Labor Relations Commission, a South Korean government organisation that handles labour disputes, cleared the way for strike action at the country's top car maker, the Hyundai Motor union said in a statement. The commission recognised large differences in positions between the company's management and union, Yonhap News Agency said on Monday. A commission spokesperson was not available for comment. The union said it would gather on Wednesday to decide what the next move would be. Members had voted on Friday to walk out unless the company accepted demands for wage increases and an extension of the retirement age. Union officials have said they would continue talks with management regardless. If the strike goes forward, it would be the first such action in five years related to wage negotiations at Hyundai Motor and could disrupt delivery of some popular vehicles. Hyundai has been struggling to ramp up production because of prolonged component shortages. The strike could cause up to 1 trillion won ($755.37 million) in operating losses, and put pressure on domestic sales as there is little backlog to sell, KB Securities said in a research note on Monday.

"Ford Motor Co's health insurance antitrust suit filed too late, Blue Cross argues",https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/ford-motor-cos-health-insurance-antitrust-suit-filed-too-late-blue-cross-argues-2023-08-25/,"Aug 25 (Reuters) - Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and its Michigan affiliate have asked a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit from Ford Motor (F.N) accusing them of a conspiracy that artificially inflated how much the automaker was paying for insurance premiums and other commercial health insurance services. In a pair of filings, the Blue Cross defendants on Thursday argued Ford had not shown that the insurers blocked any competing company from selling insurance products. The insurers also alleged that Ford's claims, filed in May in Detroit federal court, were either entirely or mostly outside of legal time frame for antitrust lawsuits. Michigan's Blue Cross Blue Shield said in its filing that it ""has been operating openly — in full view of Ford — for years and invested billions of dollars building the Blue brand in Michigan. If Ford had a claim to bring, it should have brought it long ago."" Ford's lawsuit is an offshoot of a multibillion-dollar antitrust case against Blue Cross that has been litigated since 2012. Ford was among other major U.S. companies that opted out of a $2.7 billion dollar settlement in 2020 in Alabama federal court. The settlement is under review in a U.S. appeals court. A separate class action from healthcare providers is ongoing. A Ford spokesperson on Friday declined to comment. Blue Cross Blue Shield Association declined to comment, and its Michigan affiliate did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In its complaint, Ford alleged that Blue Cross organizations have schemed to curb competition, depriving the vehicle manufacturer of ""the opportunity to purchase health insurance products and services from a lower cost competitor and/or at a price set by the free market."" Ford said it had spent more than $500 million on premiums since 2009 for certain Blue Cross products. Ford's lawsuit seeks triple damages and other remedies. In its filing, the Michigan Blue Cross affiliate defended its role as the state's exclusive Blue Cross-branded licensee. ""Ford ostensibly complains that it is not able purchase 'Blue' insurance products from more companies, but that is not an injury in any sense of the word,"" lawyers for the Michigan affiliate wrote. ""It is merely the result of lawful trademark use."" The affiliate's lawyers also argued that Ford had not shown how the Michigan licensee holds market power in a nationwide insurance market.

Hyundai Motor's union in South Korea votes to strike,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/hyundai-motors-union-south-korea-votes-strike-2023-08-24/,"SEOUL, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor's (005380.KS) unionised workers in South Korea voted on Friday for possible strike action after two months of talks with the company over wage increases and an extension of the retirement age stalled last week. The union, one of the biggest in the country with about 44,000 members, said 88.93% of its members had approved strike action unless the company accept the demands. A strike would mark the first such action in five years related to wage negotiations at the South Korean carmaker and could disrupt delivery of some popular vehicles, which Hyundai has been struggling to ramp up due to prolonged component shortages. The union is seeking a minimum basic monthly pay increase of 184,900 won ($139) and a performance pay equating to 30% of Hyundai's 2022 net profit. It is also demanding an increase to the retirement age to 64 from 60. A union official said it will continue working-level negotiations with the management regardless of the result. Hyundai Motor did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. South Korea's rising life expectancy and weaker social safety net, such as retirement pension, have attributed to workers' demand to raise the retirement age, according to experts. ""South Korea has relatively low pension replacement rates, compared to other advanced countries in Europe,"" said Park Ji-soon, a social security law professor at Korea University's School of Law. ""While those advanced European countries have replacement rates at about 60-70%, South Korea's rate practically stands at about 30%, which make it difficult for people to replace their pre-retirement wages,"" he said. Unionised workers at Hyundai in South Korea held a four-hour strike for one day in July in support of a general strike, but it was not related to the union's wage negotiations with the management. Analysts said the union would likely avoid prolonged industrial action partly due to unfavourable public sentiment, as the auto industry remains one of few bright spots in the country's sluggish economy. ""We are not expecting the strike to last too long even if the union does stage a strike. However, if the strike lasts longer than three days, which could be viewed as about 10% of Hyundai's monthly output, it could visibly disrupt Hyundai's operations,"" said Kim Jinwoo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Shares in Hyundai Motor closed down 0.1%, versus the benchmark KOSPI's (.KS11) 0.7% fall.

Xpeng's former autonomous driving head joins Nvidia,https://www.reuters.com/technology/xpengs-former-autonomous-driving-head-joins-nvidia-2023-08-24/,"SHANGHAI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The former vice president and head of autonomous driving at Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng (9868.HK), Wu Xinzhou, is joining U.S. artificial intelligence giant Nvidia (NVDA.O), he said on Thursday. Wu did not disclose what role he was taking up at Nvidia but Chinese media outlet Jiemian News said he would become its head of automotive products. It did not give a source for the news. Wu did not immediately respond to a request for further details from Reuters. Nvidia also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wu, who resigned from Xpeng this month, said on his Weibo account that he had joined Nvidia, posting a photo of himself alongside Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Xpeng's chairman He Xiaopeng.

Analysis: Parts makers risk cash crunch in a Detroit auto strike,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/parts-makers-risk-cash-crunch-detroit-auto-strike-2023-08-24/,"DETROIT, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Many smaller U.S. manufacturers that supply parts to the Detroit Three automakers will be at risk if a long United Auto Workers strike shuts down assembly lines starting next month, industry executives and analysts said. Many small and medium-sized auto parts manufacturers are in a weak financial condition after the shock of pandemic shutdowns and subsequent semiconductor shortages that depressed vehicle production at General Motors (GM.N), Ford (F.N) and Stellantis NV's (STLAM.MI) North American operations for much of the past three years, industry experts told Reuters. A strike by the UAW is not a certainty. But the substantial wage and benefit gains that UAW President Shawn Fain has demanded, and the intensity of the campaign the union has mounted, have Detroit industry executives and analysts bracing for walkouts next month. The UAW staged a 42-day strike against GM in 2019 before reaching a new contract. With regional banks tightening credit, some smaller parts makers could run out of cash or struggle to re-start production once the Detroit Three and the UAW come to terms and assembly lines roll, industry experts said. The auto parts manufacturing industry employs 4.8 million people, according to the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association trade group. Many of those jobs are in Michigan, Ohio and other Midwestern U.S. states, as well as the Canadian province of Ontario. Small suppliers are critical to automakers' supply chains. If even one bracket or bolt or plastic interior part doesn't arrive at an assembly line, production could stop. Automakers have spent much of the past three years dealing with supply chain disruptions, and are still working to recover. ""There's no question, there will be a strong ripple effect down through the supply chain,"" said Daniel Rustmann, a shareholder in Detroit's Butzel law firm who works with auto suppliers. ""It could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back."" Some suppliers are already securing for a storm. ""Our revenue is going to take a hit of 10 to 20%,"" said Todd Olson, chief executive of Twin City Die Castings Co in Minneapolis, which manufactures an array of metal components for automakers. Olson said he is working to keep inventory in check. A short strike would not force much change in Twin City's operations. A longer strike would mean laying off some workers. But that comes with risks because of the low unemployment rate, he said. ""If it's three months or something they're gonna have other jobs right? They're not coming back,"" he said. Laurie Harbour, president of Harbour Results, said she is concerned by the number of her firm's auto parts-making clients who are not yet preparing for UAW walkouts. About 30% of a population of 400 companies whose 2022 financial data Harbour Results studied ""is what we call unbankable. Their debt levels are too high and they are not turning a profit,"" Harbour said. The share of troubled companies in the latest survey is up from 20% based on 2021 data. Many companies could be in worse shape now because production volumes remain below pre-pandemic levels, while borrowing costs and other expenses are higher, she said. UAW's Fain has said Sept. 14, the end of the current UAW master contracts with the Detroit Three, is a ""deadline, not a reference point."" UAW members are voting this week to authorize strikes if new agreements are not concluded, and UAW leaders organized what they called ""practice pickets"" at certain plants this week. The union is seeking an end to a wage system that pays new hires less than veterans doing the same work, a 40% increase in hourly wages, restoration of cost-of-living adjustments and reinstatement of defined benefit pension plans for all UAW employees. Automakers and the UAW agreed during the 2007 financial crisis to end pensions for newly-hired workers, replacing them with individually-managed 401(k) accounts. Restoring pensions could add significant new liabilities to automakers' books. Smaller Detroit Three suppliers will not have smooth sailing once the UAW contract talks are concluded, said Peter West of Actify, a firm that advises suppliers on automotive program management, and Mark Barrott of the Detroit consulting and accounting firm Plante Moran. Suppliers face demands to invest in engineering and production equipment for a tsunami of new vehicle programs over the next few years as automakers develop new electric vehicles and try to sustain profitable combustion models, West said in an interview. Over the longer term, however, automakers will be trying to cut the number of parts they order and simplify product lines, Barrott said. ""It's not going to go smoothly,"" he said."

Ultium did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Strong demand for workers has given organized workers an upper hand at the bargaining table. GM, which is part of Detroit Three automakers, is also negotiating labor deal with United Auto Workers (UAW)."
Exclusive: Northvolt raises $1.2 billion in latest funding round for factory build out - CFO,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/northvolt-raises-12-bln-latest-funding-round-factory-build-out-cfo-2023-08-22/,"STOCKHOLM/LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Swedish lithium-ion battery producer Northvolt has raised $1.2 billion from investors including BlackRock (BLK.N) and several Canadian pension plans as it prepares to build new factories in Europe and North America, its finance chief told Reuters. The fresh funding, through a convertible note, comes as investor demand for companies set to benefit from the move to a low-carbon economy picks up pace, aided by policy initiatives in both regions to accelerate the transition. ""It's a very capital intensive industry... finding the right mix is always hard in this new greenfield kind of transitional projects,"" Chief Financial Officer Alexander Hartman said in an interview. Leading the round alongside BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, were Canada Pension Plan, Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and, as previously reported, pension investor Investment Management Corporation of Ontario. ""The battery manufacturing sector has attractive growth potential driven by the accelerating adoption of battery storage and electric vehicles,"" said David Giordano, global head of climate infrastructure at BlackRock. ""As a leading investor in the energy transition, we look forward to supporting their continued growth."" Other investors to take part included Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Baillie Gifford, Swedbank Robur (SWEDa.ST), Singapore's GIC and Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook Enterprises. A number of funds to invest in the note were classed as 'dark green' under the European Union's sustainable finance framework, a stamp of environmental approval that bodes well for future interest in the company, which ultimately hopes to list, Hartman said. The fresh funds will help the firm expand its factory footprint, Hartman said. The firm currently has several factories across Europe with the latest a 600 million euros ($654 million) investment to build a plant in Germany, announced in May. While the company has a facility in the United States, sources said the company is close to finalising plans to build a multibillion-dollar battery factory in Canada that will be announced later this year. Northvolt declined to comment on the factory plans. With the latest round, Northvolt has raised more than $9 billion in debt and equity since 2017 in its bid to become Europe's biggest battery manufacturer, including $1.1 billion in convertible notes last year from multiple investors. It has secured orders of over $55 billion from customers such as BMW, Fluence, Scania, Volvo Cars and Volkswagen. Separately, Northvolt has assembled its first energy storage system products in Poland and expects to start customer deliveries from later this year. ""We have a business plan... we always want to make sure we have access to the markets,"" Hartman said. He declined to comment on whether the company was preparing to go public. Reuters has previously reported, citing sources, that Northvolt was preparing for an initial public offering that could value the company at more than $20 billion. ($1 = 0.9176 euros)"
Continental considers sell-off of ContiTech car business - manager magazin,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/continental-considering-sale-contitechs-car-division-manager-magazin-2023-08-21/,"BERLIN, Aug 21 (Reuters) - German auto parts supplier Continental (CONG.DE) is considering the sale of the car division currently bundled within ContiTech, manager magazin reported on Monday, citing company sources. The possible sale would be part of a wider reorganisation of the company being planned by Supervisory Board Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle and the executive board around CEO Nikolai Setzer, the publication added, citing the sources. Continental has taken a series of steps in recent years to restructure and boost profitability as its market capitalisation tumbled to 13 billion euros ($14.17 billion) from 50 billion in 2018. The company said in February it was reorganising ContiTech from six divisions into one in each of Europe, the Americas and Asia Pacific, while bundling its car activities into a separate unit geared towards electromobility. According to manager magazin, that unit - specialised in belts and sealing systems with a turnover of more than 2 billion euros - is due to be separated from the business within two years. It could be sold, split up further or merged with another company, the publication reported. The highly profitable tyres business and non-automotive part of ContiTech will be retained as the future core, it said, quoting an unnamed top manager who warned of the threat of a workforce rift if the tyres business continued financing the cars business. Continental declined to comment on the report. The company said in May that ContiTech would be realigned with the aim of enhancing its impact and efficiency, without providing further details.

UAW leader says Detroit Three automakers 'still not serious' in contract talks,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/price-strike-detroit-automakers-5-billion-study-2023-08-17/,"DETROIT, Aug 17 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain told Reuters the Detroit Three automakers are ""still not serious"" in their responses so far to the union's economic proposals, and said Sept. 14 is a firm deadline for all three companies to conclude new contracts. ""Things have been moving slow,"" Fain said in an interview. He did not rule out strikes at General Motors (GM.N), Ford (F.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI) North America if the deadline is missed. ""Everyone's deadline is the same,"" Fain said. ""It's imperative all three companies come to the table."" Fain has outlined an ambitious set of goals, including ending the current tiered wage system that pays new hires less than veterans, reinstating cost-of-living adjustments, or COLA, and restoring defined-benefit pension plans that the automakers ended years ago for new hires. The UAW president has rattled automakers with combative rhetoric, delivered via Facebook Live videos, including one where he threw contract proposals from Stellantis into a trash can. With less than a month to reach new contracts, concerns about the impact of a walkout by UAW members at one or all of the Detroit Three are growing. While the Detroit Three represent only a portion of the total U.S. auto industry, their workers are concentrated in Michigan - a pivotal 2024 election state. U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday urged the automakers and the union to come to a ""fair agreement."" The UAW has not endorsed Biden's re-election, and Fain said he still is not ready to do so. Biden's statement ""was a good step, but we still have a ways to go in this,"" Fain said. ""We’re in a real fight with the Big Three. We have to know who our friends are. Our endorsements are going to be earned."" Fain elaborated on the UAW's proposal to expand defined-benefit pension plans for all union workers. The three automakers have signaled such a move would add billions in liabilities and make their unionized U.S. operations uncompetitive. Fain said the union's analysis concluded that the automakers could fund defined-benefit plans for roughly the same cost as current 401(k) savings plans. ""The numbers are extremely close,"" Fain said. The more than 143,000 UAW members at the Detroit Three are voting this week and next to authorize Fain to call a strike at any of the companies if deals are not reached by the deadline. While strike authorization votes are a normal feature of bargaining in the U.S. auto sector and other industries, the tension surrounding this year's contract talks in Detroit is not. The Anderson Economic Group, based in East Lansing, Michigan, on Thursday released an estimate that a ten-day UAW strike that shuts down the Detroit Three automakers could cost the manufacturers, workers, suppliers and dealers more than $5 billion. Of the $5 billion in total losses, $859 million would be wages lost by striking workers, Anderson's study estimated. Walkouts at the Detroit Three could benefit Tesla (TSLA.O) and other non-union automakers including Toyota Motor (7203.T), Honda Motor (7267.T), Nissan Motor (7201.T) and Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), Anderson said."
Stellantis invests more than $100 million in California lithium project,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-invests-more-than-100-million-california-lithium-project-2023-08-17/,"Aug 17 (Reuters) - Automaker Stellantis said it would invest more than $100 million in California's Controlled Thermal Resources, its latest bet on the direct lithium extraction (DLE) sector amid the global hunt for new sources of the electric vehicle battery metal. The investment by the Chrysler and Jeep parent announced on Thursday comes as the green energy transition and U.S. Inflation Reduction Act have fueled concerns that supplies of lithium and other materials may fall short of strong demand forecasts. DLE technologies vary, but each aims to mechanically filter lithium from salty brine deposits and thus avoid the need for open pit mines or large evaporation ponds, the two most common but environmentally challenging ways to extract the battery metal. Stellantis, which has said half of its fleet will be electric by 2030, also agreed to nearly triple the amount of lithium it will buy from Controlled Thermal, boosting a previous order to 65,000 metric tons annually for at least 10 years, starting in 2027. ""This is a significant investment and goes a long way toward developing this key project,"" Controlled Thermal CEO Rod Colwell said in an interview. The company plans to spend more than $1 billion to separate lithium from superhot geothermal brines extracted from beneath California's Salton Sea after flashing steam off those brines to spin turbines that will produce electricity starting next year. That renewable power is expected to cut the amount of carbon emitted during lithium production. Rival Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) has struggled to produce lithium from the same area given large concentrations of silica in the brine that can form glass when cooled, clogging pipes. Colwell said a $65 million facility recently installed by Controlled Thermal can remove that silica and other unwanted metals. DLE equipment licensed from Koch Industries would then remove the lithium. ""We're very happy with the equipment,"" he said. ""We're going to deliver. There's just no doubt about it."" Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares called the Controlled Thermal partnership ""an important step in our care for our customers and our planet as we work to provide clean, safe and affordable mobility."" Both companies declined to provide the specific investment amount. Controlled Thermal aims to obtain final permits by October and start construction of a commercial lithium plant soon thereafter, Colwell said. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is leading the search for additional debt and equity financing, he added. Controlled Thermal had separately agreed to supply lithium to General Motors (GM.N) by 2024, but that goal has been pushed to 2025, Colwell said. GM said it has a ""close working relationship"" with Controlled Thermal but deferred comment on technical questions to its junior partner. GM added it believes it has enough raw material supply to reach its target of producing 1 million EVs by 2025. Stellantis also has an investment in Vulcan Energy Resources (VUL.AX), which is developing a German DLE project."
UAW presses for strike vote at Detroit Three automakers,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-workers-may-vote-strike-detroit-three-automakers-next-week-2023-08-15/,"Aug 15 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers members have until Aug. 24 to vote to authorize strikes at the Detroit Three automakers if they don't have a new contract deal in hand by the time the current agreement expires in about 30 days, the union said on Tuesday. The UAW's move comes as the union and General Motors (GM.N), Ford Motor (F.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI) have made little headway with their negotiations, UAW President Shawn Fain said in a Facebook meeting with members on Tuesday. He urged members to approve the strike authorization, saying it would show the automakers that ""we're done taking their crap and the scraps they want to feed us,"" Fain said. He directed union locals to begin strike authorization voting immediately and to transmit the results to UAW International by the end of the day on Thursday, Aug 24. The workers' current contract expires on Sept. 14. ""Whether or not there's a strike next month is entirely up to the Big Three automakers,"" Fain said in a statement earlier on Tuesday. The UAW wants to improve pay and benefits and end a two-tier pay system that contributes to wage erosion. ""Our priorities are clear, the companies can afford them, and there's plenty of time for the Big Three to get serious about these negotiations."" The UAW said the talks with all three companies have yet to progress beyond non-economic issues. The three automakers have said they want to reach a deal that is fair to the workers but also gives the companies flexibility at a time when the industry is shifting from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric models that have fewer parts and require less labor. U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday called on the automakers and the UAW to reach ""a fair agreement"" before the contracts expire. The union represents 150,000 workers at the three companies. The announcement comes as labor unions are taking advantage of low unemployment to push for higher pay and better working conditions during talks for new labor agreements. The UAW has repeatedly pointed out how the three automakers have reported a combined $250 billion in profits from 2013 to 2022 and argued the hourly workers deserve to benefit as well. The union is seeking raises of 40% over a four-year contract, cost-of-living adjustments, elimination of a tiered wage system, and including workers at joint-venture battery plants in its contracts. Several analysts on Wall Street have said the chances for a strike are greater than 50%. Deutsche Bank previously estimated that a strike would hit earnings at each affected automaker by about $400 million to $500 million per week of production. The UAW said Tuesday that it recently raised strike pay to $500 per week per member and has over $825 million in its strike fund."
CFOs are stepping into a rapidly revolving door,https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/cfos-are-stepping-into-rapidly-revolving-door-2023-08-14/,"NEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chief financial officers are stepping into an increasingly rapidly revolving door. Finance chiefs at companies from Alphabet (GOOGL.O) to Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O) are changing roles, moving employers, or quitting at a faster rate than usual this year. Though explanations vary, higher turnover looks here to stay. Tesla (TSLA.O) boss Elon Musk last week thanked his “Master of Coin” Zachary Kirkhorn, who is giving up the financial reins he has held since 2019, for his 13 “often difficult years” of service at the electric carmaker. Nestle’s (NESN.S) finance chief Francois-Xavier Roger announced in May he was leaving the Swiss consumer giant to pursue new challenges. His replacement is Anna Manz, who moved on from the same position at the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG.L) after less than three years. In the first half of this year, 103 of the top 1,000 companies ranked by Fortune lost their CFO, according to executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles. In the same period a year earlier, the figure was just 79. If the trend persists, one in five companies on the list will replace their CFO this year – the highest proportion in over a decade. Economic gyrations may be partly to blame. CFOs are grappling with rising inflation and interest rates – in some cases, for the first time in their careers. That’s putting pressure on the bottom line. For companies in the S&P 500 Index (.SPX), second-quarter earnings blending actual results and analysts’ estimates are down 3.8% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S. Other duties, from wrangling with uppity investors to shaping strategy, add to the workload. Some CFOs are climbing the corporate ladder. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat, who previously held the same position at Morgan Stanley (MS.N), recently moved up to be the technology giant’s president and chief investment officer. Former Comcast (CMCSA.O) CFO Mike Cavanagh stepped up to president last year and now leads NBCUniversal. Others are turning their backs on spreadsheets. Of the executives counted in Heidrick & Struggles’ turnover tally almost one in three are retiring. These include FedEx’s (FDX.N) Mike Lenz, Unilever’s (ULVR.L) Graeme Pitkethly and Walt Disney’s (DIS.N) Christine McCarthy, a 23-year veteran of the media company, who left in July to spend time with her family. Walgreens' James Kehoe is moving to the tech industry. Faster rotation seems here to stay. The average tenure for CFOs in the first half of 2023 was 4.9 years, according to search firm Crist Kolder Associates, down from 5.3 years a decade ago. Over the same period, chief executive officers increased the time they spend in the corner office. High CFO turnover looks far from transitory. Follow @jennifersaba on Twitter CONTEXT NEWS Tesla said on Aug. 7 that its Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn was stepping down. The automaker appointed Vaibhav Taneja to succeed Kirkhorn. Alphabet on July 25 announced CFO Ruth Porat would become president and chief investment officer. (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)"
Ex-Aston Martin CEO Palmer joins British battery sensor maker Brill,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ex-aston-martin-ceo-palmer-joins-british-battery-sensor-maker-brill-2023-08-14/,"LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Former Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer has joined Brill Power as chairman to help the British battery sensor maker build its business with major automakers and the energy storage industry, the company said on Tuesday. Brill Power is a spin-out from Oxford University and has developed sensors that can monitor and manage individual cells in electric vehicle (EV) battery packs. This overcomes a core problem for EVs, where performance is determined by the weakest cell in any battery pack, and can extend a battery pack's range and life by 60%, Palmer said. The technology can also be used to determine a used EV battery's health and allow prospective buyers to judge how long the vehicle might realistically last, Palmer told Reuters. Brill Power's technology is currently in tests in one upcoming electric model that could be on the road in two years and the company is talking to a number of automakers about a range of affordable EVs and high-performance models. ""The goal here is basically to take this group of very smart individuals and give them a little bit of guidance in the commercial world,"" Palmer said of his new role at Brill Power, which raised $10.5 million last year to scale up its operations. Palmer, who oversaw the launch of the Leaf EV over a decade ago while chief operating officer at Nissan (7201.T), is also currently interim CEO at British EV charger company Pod Point (PODP.L) and chairman of Slovak battery startup Inobat."
"Biden urges automakers, union to make 'a fair agreement'",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-urges-all-sides-make-deal-automakers-union-seek-contract-2023-08-14/,"WASHINGTON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday called for union auto workers and Detroit's Big Three automakers to come together on a new agreement before their contracts expire next month. ""I’m asking all sides to work together to forge a fair agreement,"" Biden said in a statement as talks continued between the United Auto Workers (UAW) and Ford (F.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Stellantis' (STLAM.MI) Chrysler unit. ""As we move forward in this transition to new technologies, the UAW deserves a contract that sustains the middle class,"" Biden said in the statement released by the White House. The union represents 150,000 U.S. hourly workers at the three automakers and has not ruled out striking at all of them if new contracts are not reached by a Sept. 14 deadline. UAW President Shawn Fain briefed Biden last month on the negotiations and met with U.S. lawmakers as the union pushes for higher wages and benefits. He has also criticized some of the Biden administration's electric vehicle policies, and the union so far has not endorsed Biden's re-election bid. Biden, a Democrat, campaigned on union support and has weighed in on labor talks in the railroad industry and other sectors. Addressing climate change is also a key part of his agenda. ""I support a fair transition to a clean-energy future,"" he said on Monday. UAW is seeking to include workers at joint-venture vehicle battery plants in its contracts. Fain said the union appreciated Biden's support. ""As the president said, the UAW helped build the middle class and we are fighting for contracts that will bring prosperity back to working-class communities that have been struggling for far too long,"" Fain said in a statement. GM said it will ""bargain in good faith"" with the union. ""We agree it is critical for all sides to work together on a fair labor contract – a contract that provides job security and supports good wages and benefits for our team members while enabling companies to compete successfully domestically and globally,"" it said in a statement. Ford said it looked ""forward to working with the UAW on creative solutions during this time when our dramatically changing industry needs a skilled and competitive workforce more than ever."" Stellantis said it ""remains committed to working constructively and collaboratively with the UAW to negotiate a new agreement that balances the concerns of our 43,000 employees."" Shares of the automakers were nearly flat on Monday. A strike would hit earnings at each affected automaker by about $400 million to $500 million per week of production, Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner said in a research note on Monday. The union's proposals for wage increases, cost-of-living adjustments and elimination of a tiered wage system also carry costs for automakers, Rosner noted. Deutsche Bank estimated that total incremental contract costs to the three automakers combined in the ""higher probability"" scenario would be $3.6 billion in the first year and total $23 billion in the four years of the contract."
Ford taps Apple exec to build high-margin digital services,https://www.reuters.com/business/ford-names-former-apple-exec-president-integrated-services-unit-2023-08-14/,"Aug 14 (Reuters) - Ford Motor (F.N) on Monday named former Apple (AAPL.O) executive Peter Stern as the president of its newly formed Ford Integrated Services unit to help build new high-margin digital and subscription services. Stern, who previously oversaw Apple TV+, iCloud and Apple News+, will report to Ford CEO Jim Farley. In his new role, Stern will focus on integrating hardware, software and services across the company's Ford Blue, Model e and Ford Pro units. Like other U.S. automakers, Ford is looking to expand beyond its traditional wholesale-to-dealer business model and build recurring revenues from services connected to its vehicles, much as Apple has built on its hardware products. Stern joins an executive team at Ford that includes another Apple alumnus, Doug Field, who is chief advanced product development and technology officer. Rival General Motors (GM.N) in May also hired a former Apple executive, Michael Abbott, to run its software business. Farley, in a media briefing on Monday, said a new digital vehicle architecture, due out in 2025 with the arrival of Ford's next-generation electric vehicles, will enable the development of new services for both retail and commercial customers. ""We're not going to limit it to EVs - we're going to put it on the F-150,"" Ford's best-selling pickup truck, Farley said. Ford now has more than 550,000 paid software and services subscribers, more than 80% of them through the Ford Pro commercial unit. That business is generating ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in revenue, Farley said, ""with enormous margins"" of 50% and more. Stern said Ford plans to create ""bundles of services"" that will provide ""safer, more convenient and more productive experiences"". ""The basis for differentiation is shifting from the vehicles alone to the integration of hardware, software and services,"" Stern said. One of Stern's first tasks is to help expand Ford's BlueCruise hands-free driving package, which is being extended to more vehicles in the 2024 model year. Ford will install BlueCruise hardware on another 500,000 vehicles next year, while giving customers the option of activating the subscription package at any point during ownership, rather than just at time of purchase. The automaker plans to offer BlueCruise in a wider variety of Ford and Lincoln models, including F-150, F-150 Lightning, Expedition, Navigator, Nautilus and Corsair. When Stern joined Apple in 2016, the company's services included iCloud and Apple Music. ""When I left, (Apple) had over a billion customers subscriptions,"" he said."
Chrysler owner calls for focus on reality in UAW labor talks,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chrysler-parent-stellantis-criticizes-uaw-demands-labor-talks-2023-08-11/,"Aug 11 (Reuters) - Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) sharply criticized the demands of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union on Friday, saying they need ""a focus on reality from everyone involved."" Stellantis North America Chief Operating Officer Mark Stewart said in a letter to employees seen by Reuters the automaker is ""committed to working with the UAW to reach an agreement based on economic realism."" A UAW spokesman declined immediate comment on Stewart's letter, but earlier this week UAW President Shawn Fain called the Stellantis proposals ""trash"" and tossed a copy of them in a waste basket in live streamed remarks. Stewart added that agreeing to Fain's ""demands could endanger our ability to make decisions in the future that provide job security for our employees. This is a losing proposition for all of us."" The current four-year contracts with Stellantis, General Motors (GM.N) and Ford Motor (F.N) expire Sept. 14. The UAW has said it is seeking ""audacious and ambitious"" improvements, including pay raises of more than 40% over four years, significant additional time off, and a restoration of defined-benefit pensions previously eliminated for newer workers. Fain Tuesday criticized numerous concessions Stellantis is seeking. ""Stellantis proposals are a slap in the face,"" Fain said disclosing the company was proposing cuts to healthcare coverage, fewer vacation days for new hires and lifting a cap on temporary employees. Stewart said Fain did not fairly represent the negotiations. ""The theatrics and personal insults will not help us reach an agreement,"" Stewart wrote, adding ""now is the time to come to the table with open minds and a commonsense approach."" He added ""at this very early stage, no one should jump to any conclusions about the outcome of the process."" Stellantis has made proposals aimed at reducing absenteeism and cutting pension, healt-care and other costs, saying that amid government electric vehicle rules, it was imperative to ""find ways to reduce the overall fixed cost structure of our business"". The UAW also said the company opposes an end to two-tier wages, a practice of newer hires getting paid much less than veteran workers. Two people briefed on the matter told Reuters this week automakers have estimated the UAW's contract demands could raise the current mid-$60-per-hour labor rate to more than $150 per hour."
Indian startup Exponent eyes funding to grow rapid charging business,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/indian-startup-exponent-eyes-funding-grow-rapid-charging-business-2023-08-11/,"NEW DELHI, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Exponent Energy, an Indian rapid charging startup, is in talks with new and existing investors to raise money to expand its energy services business to three-wheeled passenger vehicles and buses, its chief executive told Reuters in an interview. The maker of electric vehicle batteries that can be fully charged in 15 minutes using its rapid charger, expects to close the round by end of 2023, its Chief Executive Arun Vinayak said. He declined to give details of the amount but said it would be bigger than the $13 million Exponent raised last year from investors including venture capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners. India wants to electrify its road transport including buses, commercial vehicles, cars and scooters in an effort to reduce pollution and cut fuel imports. Meanwhile, clean delivery fleets help e-commerce and consumer goods companies meet their own emission targets. This is giving a boost to Indian startups, such as Exponent, which currently makes electric vehicle batteries and provides a network of fast chargers for cargo company Altigreen, with its batteries now fitted in over 200 three-wheeled cargo vehicles. Exponent has an order book for another 400 cargo vehicles and 30 buses, Vinayak said. By the end of 2025 it expects to power a total of 25,000 vehicles and become profitable with revenues of around 6 billion rupees ($72 million), he added. Exponent's 15-minute charging means vehicles can be fitted with a smaller battery - the most expensive component - making the EVs cheaper and more accessible, Vinayak said. It also makes the charging business more viable because of faster turnaround times. Altigreen's three-wheelers have a range of 70 to 95 km on a single battery charge, he said. ""Because the battery is almost 30% smaller, the vehicle price comes down significantly. That's the one big advantage,"" he said. Exponent uses water-based technology to cool the battery while charging which prevents overheating."
Magna says job cuts likely in case of labor strike,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/magna-says-job-cuts-likely-case-labor-strike-2023-08-09/,"Aug 9 (Reuters) - Canadian auto-parts maker Magna International (MG.TO) said on Wednesday it was prepared to consider laying off staff in the short term to combat disruptions in case of a strike by United Auto Workers (UAW) union at the Detroit Three carmakers. UAW has been in negotiations with the carmakers - Ford Motor (F.N), General Motors(GM.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI) - on double-digit pay increases and defined-benefit pensions for all workers. ""We have prepared for a scenario of shutdown locations, including moving around non-essential work and beyond that we're looking at laying off people in the short term,"" Magna Chief Financial Officer Patrick McCann said at a JPMorgan auto conference. Parts supplier Aptiv PLC (APTV.N) has also said its business can adjust down in the event of a labor disruption. Magna also warned that while chip supply and margins have improved over the months, the levels are still well below those in 2019. Last week, the company raised its annual forecasts on solid demand for auto parts."
U.S. judge greenlights Nio investor class action over factory claims,https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-greenlights-nio-investor-class-action-over-factory-claims-2023-08-09/,"Aug 9 (Reuters) - Nio Inc investors can proceed as a class in a lawsuit claiming the Chinese electric vehicle maker lied about building its own factory in Shanghai during its 2018 initial public offering, a U.S. judge has ruled. The lawsuit in federal court in New York seeks damages from Nio, its executives and underwriters for a decline in share price after the carmaker said in March 2019 that it had scrapped plans to build the new factory it had said was ""under construction"" during the IPO. U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis issued an order late Tuesday certifying a class of all investors who bought Nio American Depositary Shares (ADS) in the September 2018 IPO, and a class of investors who purchased ADS between Oct. 8, 2018 and March 5, 2019. The defendants have denied the allegations. Their attorneys did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The ruling is one of the final hurdles for the investors before a trial in the case. Securities class actions rarely go to trial; those that are not dismissed typically result in settlements. The company may also ask the judge to rule in its favor without a trial. The investors anticipated the factory would give Nio its own manufacturing capacity and alleviate its reliance on a Chinese state-owned manufacturer some analysts viewed as ""third tier."" But construction had never started, the lawsuit alleges, citing former employees and the lack of necessary construction permits. The investors also claimed Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and several other underwriters failed to properly vet the company's statements. When Nio disclosed the plant would not be built in March 2019, its ADS price dropped 30%, from around $10 to $7 per share, the investors said.

"Continental fights for price rises, to keep costs in check",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/continental-lowers-tires-outlook-declining-europe-north-america-business-2023-08-09/,"BERLIN, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Continental (CONG.DE) said it was fighting for price increases in negotiations with customers and seeking ways to further cut inventory to improve its automotive business performance. The German auto parts supplier is betting on higher pricing and a focus on premium products to compensate for a declining market in its tyres sector in North America and Europe, which together make up around 70% of its total sales. Chief Financial Officer Katja Duerrfeld said she did not expect Continental to return to pre-COVID levels of working capital, adding on Wednesday's earnings call that she forecasts it will fall by around 10% from current levels. ""We are working hard to determine the right level of inventory for the different parts and components we have."" ""We are fighting for our new price negotiations ... to make sure we get what we deserve for the products and services we provide,"" Duerrfeld added. Asked about Continental's position on ongoing negotiations over improved pay and benefits with the United Auto Workers in the United States, Deurrfeld said their demands were ""strong"" and would lead to a ""new category"" of cost inflation. Continental said it currently expects increased costs of 1.4 billion euros ($1.54 billion) from wages, salaries, energy and logistics. It said it had struggled with higher logistics costs as well as currency change effects primarily from the Chinese yuan and Mexican peso in the second quarter but expected normalisation in the second half. Continental lowered its tyre sales outlook on Wednesday to 14-15 billion euros from 14.5-15.5 billion previously, but kept its margin outlook unchanged as higher pricing and a focus on premium products boosted second quarter revenue. It needed to ""make up considerable ground"" in its automotive segment, which fell short of expectations in the second quarter partly because of currency exchange effects and freight costs. The company confirmed its lower than expected adjusted earnings margin 4.8% on sales of 10.4 billion euros, as reported in preliminary results in July. The automotive division's loss on its earnings margin of 0.6% was below the consensus of a 1% rise, despite meeting expectations for sales at 5.1 billion euros. Continental said it expects passenger car and light commercial vehicle production to rise 3-5% this year from a previous forecast of a 2-4% rise, but expects the global tyre replacement business to remain unchanged or decline by up to 2%. Preliminary figures showed Continental's global passenger car and light commercial vehicle production grew by around 16% in the second quarter compared to last year. ($1 = 0.9101 euros)"
India's Hero MotoCorp faces tax probe over links to vendor -sources,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/indias-hero-motocorp-faces-tax-probe-over-links-vendor-sources-2023-08-09/,"NEW DELHI, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Indian tax authorities are investigating motorcycle maker Hero MotoCorp's (HROM.NS) relationship with a vendor suspected of reporting about 900 million rupees ($11 million) in false expenditure, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Based on the alleged fake spending by vendor Salt Experiences, Hero MotoCorp received a tax credit, leading to suspected tax evasion of about 160 million rupees, one of the two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. A spokesperson for Hero MotoCorp said ""there is no ongoing investigation against"" the company on the matter, but did not elaborate further. Salt could not be reached for immediate comment. The probe is being conducted by the Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence (DGGI), the sources said. India's finance ministry, which oversees the DGGI, did not respond to an email seeking comment. The investigation comes after India's Directorate of Enforcement (ED), in a separate case, last week conducted searches at 12 premises owned by Hero MotoCorp and its founding shareholder Pawan Kant Munjal, seizing $3 million in assets. The first source said Salt Experiences had paid 120 million rupees to the DGGI related to the alleged tax evasion, and the investigation was ongoing. The probe by the DGGI is being monitored by other agencies, such as the ED and Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), the sources said India's MCA is also investigating Hero MotoCorp's relationship with Salt Experiences in a case related to alleged diversion of funds, two government sources told Reuters in June, adding it was looking into whether the motorcycle maker controls Salt Experiences. Hero MotoCorp said at the time that it had received no communication from the government and could not comment. ($1 = 82.8325 Indian rupees)"
UAW calls Stellantis contract offer 'trash',https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-says-chrysler-parent-stellantis-seeking-concessions-talks-2023-08-08/,"Aug 8 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers (UAW) union President Shawn Fain angrily tossed contract proposals from Stellantis (STLAM.MI) in a trash can on Tuesday, citing numerous concessions that the Chrysler parent is seeking in labor talks. ""Stellantis proposals are a slap in the face,"" Fain said during an online chat, disclosing the company is proposing cuts to health-care coverage, fewer vacation days for new hires, employer cuts to 401(k) contributions, and lifting a cap on the number of temporary employees. ""Management has chosen to spit in our faces."" During the chat Fain tossed a copy of the Stellantis proposal in a waste basket. ""That's where it belongs - in the trash - because that's what it is,"" he said. The July 27 company document seen by Reuters makes many proposals aimed at reducing absenteeism, which the automaker said cost it more than 16,000 vehicles of lost production, or $217 million in lost revenue. Stellantis also seeks to cut pension, health-care and other costs, saying that amid government electric vehicle rules, it ""is imperative we find ways to reduce the overall fixed cost structure of our business."" Stellantis said the cumulative increase in employee health-care costs over the next four years is expected to be $613 million. The UAW also said the company opposes an end to two-tier wages, a practice of newer hires getting paid much less than veteran workers. Fain cited an Aug. 1 statement Stellantis made to Reuters that the automaker is ""not seeking a concessionary agreement."" Stellantis did not comment. The UAW is seeking pay raises of more than 40% over four years, significant additional time off, and a restoration of defined-benefit pensions previously eliminated for newer workers. Stellantis' proposal said it wants to ""minimize pension costs,"" which are approximately $1 billion annually. The current four-year contracts with Stellantis, General Motors (GM.N) and Ford Motor (F.N) expire on Sept. 14. Fain warned Tuesday: ""The clock is ticking - time to get down to business."" Two people briefed on the matter told Reuters that automakers have estimated the UAW's contract demands could raise the current mid-$60-per-hour labor rate to more than $150 per hour. The UAW is also seeking to make all temporary workers at U.S. automakers permanent, add a substantial increase in paid time off, and restore retiree health-care benefits and cost-of-living adjustments. The union also wants new limits on temporary workers."
Tesla's finance chief Kirkhorn unexpectedly steps down,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cfo-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down-replaced-by-vaibhav-taneja-2023-08-07/,"Aug 7 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) finance chief Zachary Kirkhorn has stepped down, surprising analysts who considered the company veteran of 13 years as a possible successor to CEO Elon Musk. The world's largest electric vehicle automaker did not give a reason for the departure. Vaibhav Taneja, 45, replaced Kirkhorn as of Friday and will also retain his role as head of accounting. Kirkhorn plans to stay on at Tesla until the end of the year to support ""a seamless transition,"" it said. The depth of Tesla's executive bench and the company's succession planning have been issues of concern for investors, especially since Musk's 2022 purchase of Twitter, now known as X. In addition to his responsibilities at Tesla and X, Musk is also CEO of satellite firm SpaceX and owns brain-chip startup Neuralink. Kirkhorn was seen as an effective and soft-spoken balance to the more volatile Musk and was one of the most visible executives who often spoke on calls with analysts and made presentations on strategy and products. ""He was able to be an effective liaison communicator between Elon and other executives ...that would be a skill set that is hard to come by and very valuable but hard to quantify,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, a Tesla investor. Shares of Tesla were down 1% in trading after the bell. Kirkhorn's departure comes as Tesla readies the first deliveries of its delayed Cybertruck and works to complete a plant in Mexico dedicated to a mass-market EV that will be the basis for a robotaxi. During Kirkhorn's tenure, Tesla posted its first quarterly profit after ramping up production of the Model 3 compact sedan and hit a market valuation of more than $1 trillion. ""Being a part of this company is a special experience and I'm extremely proud of the work we've done together since I joined over 13 years ago,"" Kirkhorn said in a LinkedIn post. Kirkhorn did not respond to queries when contacted on LinkedIn. ""That he's going to be around until the end of the year is evidence that this is just for personal reasons and the personal reason is likely that working with Elon Musk is really hard and he's done it for 13 years,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. Kirkhorn's decision to step down marks the highest profile executive change at the company since long-time executive Jerome Guillen, who oversaw its electric Semi truck development, left in 2021. ""I would like to thank Zach Kirkhorn for his many contributions to Tesla over the course of 13 often difficult years. Much appreciated and best wishes for the next stage of his career,"" Musk said in a post on X. Taneja spent nearly 17 years at PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the big four accounting firms, before joining solar panel maker SolarCity in 2016, the same year that it was acquired by Tesla for $2.6 billion. At Tesla's shareholder meeting in May, investors rejected a proposal that asked the board to report on Tesla's ""key person"" risk. Musk said then he had no intention of leaving. Tesla director James Murdoch said in November that Musk had identified a potential successor without naming that person. The Austin, Texas-based automaker this year cut prices of its cars across all of its markets in a move that prioritizes sales growth and market share but squeezes its industry-leading margins. It has also hinted at more price cuts in what Musk called ""turbulent times."" Many analysts have accepted the case for Tesla's valuation and its ability to fund its aggressive growth plans - in part because of the company's success in taking costs out of production. ""In this industry, in this business, you survive or you die based upon the ability to manage your costs,"" Kirkhorn said at Tesla's investor day in March."
"Exclusive: As US navigates summer of strikes, Biden's top labor adviser exits, source says",https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-navigates-summer-strikes-bidens-top-labor-adviser-exits-source-says-2023-08-08/,"Aug 8 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's top labor adviser, Celeste Drake, has stepped down, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, as the administration attempts to maintain labor peace and avoid threatened strikes during an election year. Drake is leaving the White House to serve as the Deputy Director-General of the International Labor Organization (ILO), based in Geneva, Switzerland, and starts in her new role on Aug. 14, according to the source, who did not wish to be named. The ILO did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Drake's departure comes at a critical time for an administration dealing with a summer of labor unrest, with estimates from national labor unions showing more than 650,000 U.S. workers were on or threatened strikes in the first half of 2023. Hollywood actors and writers are currently on strike, and auto worker unions last month warned they are prepared to do the same unless Detroit's Big Three automakers - General Motors (GM.N), Ford Motor (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) - agree to fair contracts. Workers at UPS (UPS.N) and its Teamsters union just signed a tentative labor deal. Biden, 80, is tying his 2024 re-election bid to the health of the economy, highlighting job growth, rising wages and easing fears of a recession. Any major strike, especially of a key link in the supply chain or industry, could hurt the Democratic president's pitch. At the White House, Drake advised Biden and his team on labor negotiations that had a direct impact on the country's supply chain and the economy, current and former White House officials said. She carried the title of deputy assistant to the president as well as deputy director of the White House's economic policymaking arm, the National Economic Council (NEC). ""She was involved deeply on some of the most consequential labor negotiations that we've seen from ports to railways, and also in crafting policy around how to support workers,"" said Brian Deese, former director of the NEC, adding that her tenure came at a ""very complicated and consequential time."" Drake helped direct a team of top White House officials and three cabinet secretaries, including former Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, during the rail negotiations that helped Biden block a strike that could have devastated the American economy. Even though a majority of the unions involved in the negotiations approved the deal, some workers and labor allies criticized Biden, a staunch union backer, for the contract that increased wages but lacked paid sick leave. A competitive market for workers, increased job site risks during the pandemic, high housing and food costs, tech disruptions, expiration of cyclical contracts and union-friendly policies from the Biden administration are fueling a workers' rights movement in the country. Responding to concerns around the timing of her departure, Deese said the White House has planned for this transition and it will be able to maintain its ""strong focus on labor."" The White House did not comment on Drake's potential successor. The source said a replacement for Drake is expected to be named soon. Another key Biden labor adviser, Erika Dinkel-Smith, was recently promoted to the position of senior labor adviser within the White House's Office of Political Strategy, the source added. Gene Sperling, Biden's longtime adviser, who oversaw the implementation of the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, has also been appointed co-ordinator between the administration, the auto workers unions and the companies, the source said. A former trade specialist at the labor confederation AFL-CIO, Drake joined the administration in April 2021 as the first ever director of the Made in America Office at the White House's Office of Management & Budget. She then transitioned to the NEC in summer 2022, where she served as deputy assistant to the President and deputy director of the NEC for labor and economy. She took over the position from Biden's former top labor adviser Seth Harris. In a statement, Biden's acting secretary of labor, Julie Su, described Drake as one of the administration's ""leading authority on labor policy"" and one of its ""greatest champions for working families."" Biden's chief of staff, Jeff Zients, praised Drake's ""sharp policy focus"" and ""deep relationships"" and said ""nobody could have served better"" as Biden's voice in working with unions."
"Berkshire posts record operating profit, rising rates boost Buffett's returns",https://www.reuters.com/business/berkshire-posts-record-operating-profit-359-billion-net-income-2023-08-05/,"Aug 5 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) on Saturday posted its highest ever quarterly operating profit, while gains from stock holdings helped the conglomerate led by billionaire Warren Buffett swing to a nearly $36 billion overall profit. Rising interest rates, and better results at the Geico car insurer, allowed Berkshire's insurance businesses to generate more money in the second quarter, with profit up 38% and interest and other investment income growing sixfold. But while operating profit topped $10 billion, those same rising rates have made it more costly to buy and upgrade homes, hurting results at Berkshire's Clayton Homes and building products businesses, and buy RVs from its Forest River unit, where revenue sank 34%. Profit also fell at one of Berkshire's largest businesses, the BNSF railroad, with a 24% decline reflecting lower shipments of consumer goods, price competition from truckers, and higher pay for employees. Berkshire also appeared to remain wary of high stock prices as U.S. equities extended their rally. During the second quarter it sold $8 billion more stocks than it bought and repurchased less of its own stock, and it ended June with a near-record $147.4 billion of cash. ""The story here is interest rates, and valuations of stocks,"" said Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst with a ""buy"" rating on Berkshire. ""The earnings impact of higher interest rates on investment income is offsetting the economic softness caused by those same rates,"" he added. ""And it's clear there aren't a lot of attractive investment opportunities out there."" Investors closely watch Berkshire because of Buffett's reputation, and because results from the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's operating units often mirror broader economic trends. Those units also include Berkshire's namesake energy company, several industrial companies, and familiar brands such as Dairy Queen, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom and See's Candies. Buffett turns 93 on August 30. He is worth $117.5 billion and the world's sixth-richest person, Forbes magazine said. Quarterly operating profit rose 7% to $10.04 billion, or about $6,938 per Class A share, from $9.42 billion a year earlier. Operating results reflected recent purchases of Alleghany, whose businesses include various insurers and the toy company that makes Squishmallows, and the Pilot truck stop operator, which added $114 million of profit. Net income totaled $35.91 billion, or $24,775 per Class A share, compared with a year-earlier $43.62 billion loss. Year-earlier results reflected an accounting change for some insurance contracts. Berkshire repurchased $1.4 billion of stock in the quarter, down from $4.4 billion from January to March. It also sold $12.6 billion of stocks, while buying just $4.6 billion. Apple (AAPL.O) comprised about half of Berkshire's $353 billion equity portfolio. ""They're not loving valuations,"" said Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst with a ""hold"" rating on Berkshire. ""The quarter was strong, but organic growth trends are not that robust,"" Seifert added. ""The question that will be on investors' minds is how to position the company for strong growth without more frequent acquisitions."" Net results included $25.9 billion of largely unrealized gains from investments and derivatives, which accounting rules require Berkshire to report. This adds volatility to quarterly results, and Buffett urges investors to ignore the fluctuations. Geico posted a $514 million pre-tax underwriting profit, its second straight profitable quarter after six quarters of losses, as higher average premiums, fewer accidents and less ad spending offset a decline in policies-in-force. Overall profit from Berkshire Hathaway Energy, where Berkshire has a 92% stake, was little changed at $785 million. But the company said it faces a potential $1.02 billion of pre-tax losses, or $608 million not covered by insurance, at its PacifiCorp electric utility unit tied to a series of Oregon wildfires in 2020. An Oregon jury in June found PacifiCorp liable to homeowners for negligence after failing to shut down power lines that caused four fires. PacifiCorp plans an appeal. Results also included profit attributable to Berkshire's 25.3% stake in Occidental Petroleum (OXY.N). Berkshire also owns $8.8 billion of Occidental preferred stock, which throws off an 8% dividend, though the oil company has redeemed some of the original $10 billion it issued. The Class A shares of Berkshire closed Friday at $533,600, about 2% below their record high. They are up 14% this year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX) has risen 17%."
US fines Canoo $1.5 million over revenue projection reporting,https://www.reuters.com/legal/sec-sues-two-ex-canoo-executives-over-reporting-failures-2023-08-04/,"Aug 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission fined electric vehicle company Canoo Inc $1.5 million on Friday for what the regulator alleges were reporting failures related to hundreds of millions of dollars of unreasonable revenue projections. The SEC said Canoo, former CEO Ulrich Kranz and Paul Balciunas, its former chief financial officer, misled investors about the company's financial prospects before it went public in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company in December 2020. In the run-up to the deal, Canoo (GOEV.O) had projected revenue of $120 million in 2021 and $250 million in 2022 based on deals to provide engineering services to other companies. In March 2021, the carmaker's stock tumbled 21% after it announced it would not achieve the anticipated revenue, the SEC said in court papers. Canoo did not admit to wrongdoing in the settlement. The company said in May that it reached a tentative deal with the SEC to end the investigation, which began in April 2021. The SEC also settled with former CEO Kranz and former CFO Balciunas. Kranz agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of public companies for three years and to pay a $125,000 fine. Balciunas agreed to a two-year bar, to pay a $50,000 fine and return $7,500 in profits. The SEC said Kranz and Balciunas knew before the merger that the projects were unlikely to generate revenue. The regulator also alleged that Kranz failed to disclose more than $900,000 in compensation he received from two Canoo investors in October 2020 to stay with the company. Daniel Wachtell, an attorney for Balciunas, said his client was pleased to have the matter resolved. An attorney for Kranz declined to comment. Canoo said in May it had tentatively agreed to pay a $1.5 million penalty to settle with the SEC. A spokesperson for the company did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Friday. The Texas-based company warned investors in May that it might not be able to meet its financial obligations, saying it had access to $600 million in funding but added it had ""substantial doubt"" about continuing as a going concern. The carmaker is scheduled to report its second quarter results on Aug. 14. Canoo's stock peaked at $20.28 per share around its public debut in December 2020, but has declined, trading below $1 per share since February. The SPAC boom of 2020 and 2021 brought the likes of DraftKings Inc (DKNG.O) and electric truck maker Nikola (NKLA.O) public, but drew scrutiny from watchdogs and the SEC over what they described as less stringent due diligence. The SEC pursued a number of SPAC-related enforcement investigations and also sought to overhaul rules for the blank-check companies to boost disclosures and increase accountability."
Nikola shares plummet 26% as electric truck maker names 4th CEO in 4 years,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ev-maker-nikola-says-ceo-lohscheller-step-down-2023-08-04/,"Aug 4 (Reuters) - Nikola (NKLA.O) lost more than a quarter of its market value on Friday after the U.S. electric truck maker named its fourth CEO in as many years and reiterated for the third time this year its doubts about continuing as a going concern. The news came a day after shareholders approved a plan to issue more stock to bolster much-needed cash despite worries of dilution, as Phoenix-based Nikola navigates lingering supply chain snags and a pivot to hydrogen fuel-cell technology. The company said Chairman Stephen Girsky, a former General Motors (GM.N) executive, will immediately take over from Michael Lohscheller, who is stepping down due to a family health matter. Nikola's investors on Thursday approved a proposal that will allow the company to issue more shares. It needs $600 million to execute its business plan but it will not be entirely dilutive equity capital, Girsky said on a call with reporters. Before Friday's 26.4% fall - closing at $2.50 - Nikola's share price had soared nearly 60% this year. Nikola flagged ""substantial doubts"" about its ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months, reiterating its warning for the third time since February, as it awaits ""critical"" additional capital. Shares were also dragged by a downbeat current-quarter revenue forecast. The maker of Tre model electric trucks has decided to make battery electric trucks only to order and focus on hydrogen fuel cell trucks. The company laid off 270 employees in June and liquidated assets of a recently acquired battery maker last month. Nikola forecast third-quarter revenue of $18 million to $28 million, compared with estimates of $34.5 million, according to Visible Alpha. The company said it expects 300 to 400 deliveries this year, up from between 250 and 350 it projected earlier. Other electric vehicle (EV) startups also have toiled to ramp up production, meet delivery targets and raise funds as cash reserves dwindled. Supply chain delays forced EV maker Fisker (FSR.N) to slash its annual production target on Friday. Nikola, which also flagged supply bottlenecks, had cash and cash equivalents of $226.7 million at the end of the second quarter, compared with $441.8 million, a year earlier. Nikola this summer adjourned and rescheduled its shareholder meeting twice to build support for the share issuance among investors worried it would dilute their stakes. The move was also opposed by founder Trevor Milton, who stepped down in 2020 after fraud allegations and was later convicted. Separately, Nikola reported a narrower second-quarter loss as lower production of its Tre battery-electric trucks in the April-June period helped keep costs in check."
GM vows to boost jobs next year despite EV shift,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-vows-boost-jobs-next-year-despite-ev-shift-2023-08-04/,"Aug 4 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM.N) said Friday it plans to boost employment next year despite concerns raised by autoworkers that the shift to electric vehicles will reduce labor needs. GM, Ford Motor (F.N) and Chrysler-parent Stellantis last month opened contract talks with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union ahead of the Sept. 14 expiration of the current four-year labor deals. GM manufacturing chief, Gerald Johnson, said on Friday he did not agree it would need fewer workers for EV production. ""We actually expect our employment numbers to grow in 2024,"" Johnson said in a video message. Last year, Ford said EVs, which are simpler and have fewer mechanical parts, will require 40% less labor to build than current internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. GM has vowed to end the sale of new ICE vehicles by 2035. Another key issue in the talks involves pay and treatment of workers at GM's joint venture battery plants. Separately, CFRA Research on Friday downgraded GM on concerns about a possible strike after the UAW sought large pay and benefit hikes. GM shares closed down 1% to $36.57. Stellantis said on Friday it intends ""to fairly reward our represented employees for their contributions to the success of the Company. However, it will be critical to find common ground that doesn’t jeopardize our ability to continue investing."" The UAW is seeking a pay hike of more than 40% over the life of the four-year contract, including an initial 20% hike upon ratification and 5% annual wage hikes starting in September 2024, according to sources and a copy of the proposal. GM said on Thursday the UAW proposals ""would threaten our ability to do what's right for the long-term benefit of the team."" The union is seeking substantial wage and benefit changes, including defined-benefit pensions for all workers and shorter work weeks. It wants to make all temporary workers at U.S. automakers permanent, a substantial increase in paid time off and restore retiree health care benefits and cost of living adjustments. The UAW wants new limits on temporary workers and for them to receive profit sharing. UAW President Shawn Fain on Tuesday expressed support for a 32-hour work week, down from the traditional 40 hours. Sources said the union wants the companies to agree to the equivalent of a paid day-off per week, at a time of growing trials globally of a four-day working week."
GM criticizes autoworkers union's contract demands,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-criticizes-autoworkers-unions-contract-demands-2023-08-03/,"WASHINGTON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM) (GM.N) on Thursday said it expected to offer unionized workers higher wages, but granting the United Auto Workers' (UAW) ambitious contract demands including large pay rises would hurt its ability to make sound business decisions. Company and union sources told Reuters the UAW was seeking at least a 40% pay hike over the life of the four-year contract, including an initial 20% hike upon ratification. The UAW said earlier this week that the CEOs of the Detroit Three had won 40% pay hikes on average over the last four years and singled out GM CEO Mary Barra, who received $29 million in 2022 in total compensation. The UAW presented its economic demands to Chrysler-parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) on Tuesday, General Motors (GM.N) on Wednesday and Ford (F.N) on Thursday ahead of the Sept. 14 expiration of the current four-year contracts. GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said the proposals ""would threaten our ability to do what's right for the long-term benefit of the team."" The union said earlier it was seeking double-digit hikes in wages, defined-benefit pensions for all workers and shorter work weeks. It wants to make all temporary workers at U.S. automakers permanent, a substantial increase in paid time off and restore retiree health care benefits and cost of living adjustments. UAW President Shawn Fain on Tuesday expressed support for a 32-hour work week, down from the traditional 40 hours. Sources said the union wants the companies to agree to the equivalent of a paid day off per week, at a time of growing trials globally of a four-day working week. GM said a fair agreement would reward employees but also allow the company to retain its momentum now and into the future. ""We think it's important to protect U.S. manufacturing and jobs in an industry that is dominated by non-unionized competition,"" GM said. The UAW did not immediately comment on GM's statement. Fain on Tuesday said the union demands were its ""most audacious and ambitious"" proposals in decades. Fain also said the UAW was proposing to have the right to strike over plant closures and to eliminate a two-tier wage system under which veteran hires earn 25% or more than newer employees."
Tesla faces California class action on its EV range claims,https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-faces-california-class-action-its-ev-range-claims-2023-08-03/,"Aug 2 (Reuters) - Three Tesla (TSLA.O) owners in California on Wednesday sued the automaker in a proposed class action that accuses the company of falsely advertising the estimated driving ranges of its electric vehicles. The lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California cites a Reuters article published last week which reported Tesla had created a ""Diversion Team"" in Nevada to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible after becoming inundated with owner complaints. Reuters also reported that about a decade ago Tesla had decided to write algorithms for its in-dash range meter that would show drivers ""rosy"" projections for the distance the car could travel on a full battery, according to a source. The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, this person said. Reuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost range estimates. Neither Tesla nor Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for last week's article. They did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the lawsuit on Wednesday. The lawsuit alleges Tesla breached vehicle warranties and engaged in fraud and unfair competition. ""Put simply, Tesla has a duty to deliver a product that performs as advertised,"" Adam A. Edwards, an attorney at Milberg Coleman Bryson Phillips Grossman, the firm representing Tesla owners in the lawsuit, said in a statement. The lawsuit's three plaintiffs cite occasions when their Teslas didn't achieve close to their advertised ranges and said they had complained to the company without success. James Porter, a Petaluma, California-based Model Y owner, said in the lawsuit that on one trip he ""lost approximately 182 miles of range—despite only driving 92 miles."" The lawsuit states: ""Had Tesla honestly advertised its electric vehicle ranges, consumers either would not have purchased Tesla model vehicles, or else would have paid substantially less for them."" The complaint seeks class-action status to represent ""all persons in California who purchased a new Tesla Model 3, Model S, Model Y, and Model X vehicle."" It seeks unspecified damages. Tesla also faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its Autopilot and ""Full Self-Driving"" technology and its claims about the safety of those systems.

The lawsuit accuses Tesla of violating the privacy of its customers. Tesla has denied those allegations."
"Focus: For investors, green companies still hard to find with new emissions reporting rules",https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/investors-green-companies-still-hard-find-with-new-emissions-reporting-rules-2023-08-02/,"LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Is Ford (F.N) doing a better job of cutting emissions than rival Toyota (7203.T)? Is BP (BP.L) greener than Shell (SHEL.L)? For investors looking to weed out climate laggards from portfolios, these are vital questions but existing guidelines on emissions reporting and new rules due to come in for the United States and Europe are unlikely to provide hard answers. Most major Western companies use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) Corporate Standard for reporting emissions and the guidelines will form part of the framework for compulsory EU standards set to take effect next year. The United States is on track to announce similar rules this year and the corporate standard, first launched in 2001 and revised in 2004, is also embedded in other international emissions reporting standards. But the guidelines, which are overseen by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and World Resources Institute, define the three main categories of emissions companies should report broadly, leaving plenty of room for interpretation. Half a dozen investors interviewed by Reuters said while the GHGP has been crucial in shining a light on corporate emissions, it can be hard to compare companies given the potential for differences in disclosures, and this will remain the case to some extent even with new mandatory norms. ""More companies are disclosing, but at what quality are they actually going to disclose?"" said Vanessa Bingle, director at Alpha Financial Markets Consulting, which advises asset managers on sustainable investing. Take the autos sector. Although 20 of the top 30 automakers report emissions linked to their supply chains – known as Scope 3 under the protocol - analysis by research firm Signal Climate Analytics (SCA) seen by Reuters showed a range of approaches in how they disclose the data and for the assumptions underpinning their calculations. For example, as of March 2023, only five carmakers have disclosed their assumptions for the average life of their vehicles and grams of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted per kilometre driven. That makes comparisons problematic. An unrealistically low lifetime figure could make cars appear less polluting than they really are, SCA Executive Chairman David Lubin said. In its 2021 public submission to CDP – a non-profit that runs the global disclosure system on environmental impacts for investors, companies and governments - Japanese carmaker Subaru (7270.T) said its cars run for 130,000 km (80,000 miles) over their lifetime. In 2022, it did not disclose a figure. A search of the British version of second-hand car site AutoTrader on July 31 showed 988 Subarus for sale, of which 263, or a quarter, had done at least 80,000 miles. Subaru told Reuters the 130,000 km figure referred to vehicles sold in Japan. For the EU, it used 162,500 km and for North America, where it books most of its sales, 228,800 km, information it has not previously made public. A spokesperson said Subaru did not include a lifetime number in its 2022 disclosure because it wanted to avoid confusion with an incomplete description. ""We now believe it's better to disclose the lifetime distance assumptions by region in our next disclosure (2023)."" Experts said Scope 3 emissions were the hardest of the three areas to assess as companies have to rely on data from customers and suppliers for their calculations. SCA's Lubin said Scope 3 data was quite limited in its usefulness without researching how firms come up with their numbers and how reasonable the assumptions underpinning their data are. Nonetheless, many investors scrutinise carbon emissions data to gauge how polluting a company is, how it compares with rivals and how this might affect its bottom line and share price. For Laura Kane, head of ESG research at Voya Investment Management, which is part of Voya Financial (VOYA.N) and oversees about $323 billion in assets, in many cases, it's like comparing apples to oranges. Kane said her firm buys third-party data from ratings providers, which aim to normalise and score the data, making it more comparable across sectors, yet this brings its own challenges. She declined to name the providers. ""There is quite a bit of variation among providers ... due to inconsistent reporting from companies, as well as different estimation and aggregation methodologies."" Only big investors have deep enough pockets to pay for such data and employ teams to assess it, leaving smaller investors at a disadvantage, experts say. The EU has made carbon disclosures mandatory for about 50,000 companies operating in the bloc from next year while new U.S. rules should come this year as governments look to replace a patchwork of private sector norms with binding rules, making it easier to crack down on greenwashing or exaggerated climate-friendly claims by companies. The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), a standards-setter established by the IFRS Foundation that produces international accounting norms, has also approved rules any country can adopt. Some countries, including Britain, have said those guidelines will become mandatory. Jimmy Jia, researcher at the Oxford Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, said as well as differences in defining what should be counted under existing GHGP guidelines, companies may use different calculation processes or present data in different ways. ""Investors need to understand if a difference is due to an operational difference, or because the entities applied different accounting methodologies,"" said Jia said, co-author of a study on emissions data comparability. Another area of investor concern is how companies account for their own energy use, or Scope 2 emissions. The GHGP allows companies to buy green energy to offset their emissions, using contractual instruments such as renewable energy certificates, and reflect this in their reporting. But the protocol also allows different accounting methods - market-based or location-based - to be used when companies calculate Scope 2 numbers. The market-based approach, however, may not accurately reflect how used energy was generated, potentially resulting in investors concluding a company is less polluting than it is, some investors said. ""Market-based methods open up the door to creative accounting,"" British asset manager abrdn said in its response to a GHGP consultation that closed on March 14. Of 8,400 companies to report data globally to CDP, 70% reported Scope 2 data, with 31% giving both market and location-based figures, 33% only a location-based number and 6% just market-based, CDP data shared with Reuters showed. European and U.S. regulators and officials at the ISSB interviewed by Reuters acknowledge the criticisms of GHGP but argue that the new EU, U.S. and global standards are just the start of a journey to more accurate reporting. Best-practice, pressure from markets, and peers, along with bespoke sector disclosures, will emerge over the next five years or so to improve accuracy, as will countries requiring disclosures to be independently audited, as they do for financial reports, regulators say. A spokesperson for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment. Pedro Faria, environmental leader at EFRAG, the EU body that drafted the bloc's disclosure standards, said the priority was to make disclosures mandatory before improving the quality, and that they are just one piece of the puzzle. ""Ultimately, the thing that you need from (companies) is the big chunk of emissions and yes, there are methodological issues there, but also their investments, their transition plans, changes in strategy, and some of those aspects are even more important than precise carbon numbers,"" Faria said. The GHGP's consultation on possible changes to its framework drew over 230 proposals, of which 150 were made public while the others requested privacy. Any changes would likely take effect from 2025, at the earliest, according to GHGP. ""All feedback shared during that process will be reviewed by GHG Protocol including its Technical Working Groups and will inform the scope and potential approaches to make updates to existing standards or development of additional guidance,"" said Pankaj Bhatia, director of GHG Protocol."
GM’s Cruise says it's reached the robotaxi industry's first union agreements,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gms-cruise-says-its-reached-robotaxi-industrys-first-union-agreements-2023-08-03/,"Aug 3 (Reuters) - Cruise, General Motors' (GM.N) robotaxi unit, said on Thursday it had signed the driverless car industry's first labor union agreements, a significant milestone as unions and robotaxi firms have historically been at odds. The company is partnering with two local San Francisco union chapters that represent electrical workers and janitors, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 6 and Service Employees International Union Local 87. Reuters could not definitively determine if these are the driverless car industry’s first union agreements. The agreement will employ “dozens” of workers who will construct and staff Cruise’s car-charging facilities, the company said. ""Cruise is creating new job opportunities for our members and providing valuable on-site experience for our apprentices,” said John Doherty, IBEW Local 6's business manager. In the past, unions have eyed technology warily as increased automation has allowed companies to reduce worker counts. In the auto sector, the United Auto Workers union has voiced concern about potential job losses resulting from the shift to electric vehicles and it has made job security a top priority in the ongoing labor negotiations with the Detroit Three automakers, including GM. Cruise, which offers limited service in San Francisco with a fleet of Chevrolet Bolts fitted with driverless technology, has accumulated over 3 million driverless miles, the company said. Its rival, Alphabet Inc's <GOOGL.O> self-driving technology unit Waymo, also offers limited service in San Francisco. Both Cruise and Waymo are trying to expand their services to paying customers throughout San Francisco, but are facing backlash from city officials, who cite a rising number of robotaxi incidents. California’s Public Utilities Commission, which has jurisdiction over robotaxi regulation, has called into question the city’s data analysis and scheduled a vote for Aug. 10 to approve its own draft proposal to allow the robotaxis to continue widespread testing on city streets. Last month, U.S. regulators said they will soon decide on a February 2022 petition filed by Cruise seeking permission to deploy up to 2,500 self-driving vehicles annually without human controls such as a steering wheel, a top auto safety official said on Wednesday."
GM JV battery firm rejects including Ohio workers under national agreement,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-jv-battery-firm-rejects-including-ohio-workers-under-national-agreement-2023-08-02/,"Aug 2 (Reuters) - A General Motors (GM.N) LG Energy Solution (373220.KS) battery joint venture on Wednesday said it does not see any path for workers at its Ohio plant to be covered under a national labor agreement, rejecting a push by Democratic U.S. senators. Ultium Cells LLC said on Wednesday it ""does not see a viable legal or practical path to place Ultium Cells-Ohio into the General Motors National Agreement."" The United Auto Workers (UAW) union declined immediate comment. Last week, a group of 28 senators including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urged GM, Chrysler-parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) and Ford Motor (F.N) to recognize joint venture battery workers under national labor agreements before the current contracts expire on Sept. 14. If battery workers were covered under the national agreement, they would likely be eligible for better pay and benefits. Senators and the union have heavily criticized Ultium for paying low wages at the Ohio plant and noted some make just half as much as workers did at a nearby shuttered GM assembly plant. The senators including Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown wrote last week it is a ""national disgrace that the starting wage at any current American joint venture electric vehicle battery facility is $16 an hour,"" arguing it represents ""poverty-level wages"" amid ""extreme financial gains for the companies, executives, and investors."" Ultium said on Wednesday it ""has provided a proposal for a fully comprehensive collective bargaining agreement, including substantial wages and benefits."" In December, workers at the Ultium Cells Ohio plant overwhelmingly voted to join the UAW. Ultium said ""during our 6-month collective bargaining process, the UAW has not provided any wage proposals or counter proposals."" Stellantis North American Chief Operating Officer Mark Stewart told employees this week in a letter seen by Reuters the transition to electric vehicles ""will require us to work collaboratively to find ways to offset the 40% increase in the cost of battery-powered vehicles."" UAW President Shawn Fain said Tuesday the union was seeking double-digit pay rises, a shorter work week, defined-benefit pensions and other contract improvements. Fain singled out GM CEO Mary Barra, who received $29 million in compensation in 2022, and said it would take an entry level worker at Ultium Ohio 16 years to earn as much as she made in a week."
UAW seeks double-digit pay hikes in Detroit Three auto contract talks,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-seeks-double-digit-pay-hikes-detroit-three-contract-talks-2023-08-01/,"Aug 1 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers (UAW) President Shawn Fain said on Tuesday the union was seeking ambitious benefit increases in contract talks with the Detroit Three automakers, including double-digit pay rises and defined-benefit pensions for all workers. The UAW presented its economic demands to Chrysler-parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) on Tuesday and will make presentations to General Motors (GM) (GM.N) Wednesday and Ford (F.N) Thursday ahead of the Sept. 14 expiration of the current four-year contracts, Fain said. They include proposing to make all temporary workers at the U.S. automakers permanent, placing new strict limits on the use of temporary workers and increasing paid time off. Fain also wants increases in pension benefits for current retirees and to ensure all workers get defined-benefit pensions. The union leader, in Facebook Live remarks, called the demands ""the most audacious and ambitious list of proposals they've seen in decades."" Fain said the CEOs of the Detroit Three saw their pay rise by 40% on average over the last four years. He singled out GM CEO Mary Barra, who received $29 million of compensation in 2022, and said it would take an entry level worker at a GM joint venture battery plant 16 years to earn as much as she made in a week. Fain listed numerous demands, including restoring retiree health care benefits and cost of living adjustments. He also said the UAW was proposing to have the right to strike over plant closures and to eliminate the two-tier wage system under which new hires earn 25% or more less than veteran employees. He noted the Teamsters recently won an end to two-tiered wages in a new contract with UPS (UPS.N). ""It's wrong to make any worker a second class-worker. We can't allow it any longer,"" Fain said of the demand for the same at the Detroit Three. Stellantis said it had a ""very productive meeting"" with Fain and the bargaining committee and would review the union requests to understand how they aligned with company proposals and where common ground could be found. ""We are not seeking a concessionary agreement,"" Stellantis said. GM said it would review the demands once they were received from the UAW on Wednesday. Ford said it looked ""forward to working with the UAW on creative solutions during this time when our dramatically changing industry needs a skilled and competitive workforce more than ever."" Fain also said the Detroit Three need to pay better wages for workers at battery joint venture plants and praised Democratic senators last week for urging the companies to include those workers under the master agreements."
Pirelli gets new board after battle over Chinese influence,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/pirelli-gets-new-board-after-battle-over-chinese-influence-2023-07-31/,"MILAN, July 31 (Reuters) - Pirelli (PIRC.MI) investors on Monday approved a new board for the tyremaker, giving it a new three-year governance set-up after the Italian government last month took steps to curb the influence of the company's leading Chinese investor. Andrea Casaluci, previously General Manager Operations, has been promoted to CEO, Pirelli said in a statement. He succeeds Marco Tronchetti Provera, the Italian businessman who has been in charge since 1992. The 75-year-old Tronchetti Provera, whose Camfin vehicle is Pirelli's second largest shareholder, retains a strong voice in the new 15-strong board in the role of executive vice chairman. Pirelli's new chairman is Jiao Jian, the chief executive of leading shareholder Sinochem (600500.SS), the state-owned Chinese group. The Italian government used ""golden power"" legislation that protects key national assets to impose prescriptions on the proposed renewal of a governance pact between Sinochem and Camfin. The intervention strengthened the influence of Camfin even though it has a smaller stake than Sinochem in the company, the tyre supplier for Formula One motor racing. Camfin holds a 14.1% stake while Sinochem has 37%. As part of the measures, Camfin retained the power to designate Pirelli's CEO and set strategies, with limited power for Sinochem to influence the group's management. Twelve members of the new board were appointed from a majority slate presented by Sinochem, which included, based on the amended governance agreements, four Camfin-indicated members, including Casaluci and Tronchetti Provera. Pirelli's investors - which also include China's state-owned Silk Road Fund, with a 9% stake, and Italian brakes maker Brembo (BRBI.MI) with around 6% - approved the new board, with around 84% of the shareholding represented at the meeting voting in favour. Holders of more than 84% of Pirelli's voting capital participated at the meeting, the company said."
"Szafnauer to exit misfiring Alpine, Fry joins Williams",https://www.reuters.com/sports/motor-sports/szafnauer-leave-alpine-fry-moves-williams-2023-07-28/,"SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium, July 28 (Reuters) - Otmar Szafnauer will leave Renault-owned Alpine after Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix with Bruno Famin appointed interim principal on another day of upheaval that exposed rifts within the misfiring Formula One team. Alpine said the team's sporting director Alan Permane, who has been at the Enstone factory for 34 years, was leaving by mutual agreement while chief technical officer Pat Fry was joining Williams in the same role. Alpine Academy director Julian Rouse was named as Permane's interim replacement while Matt Harman leads the technical team at Enstone. ""Otmar will continue his duties as normal for this weekend’s race in Belgium, before leaving the team ahead of the summer break,"" Alpine said in a statement. Szafnauer, a paddock veteran who joined from Aston Martin in January last year, told reporters the decision was mutual and stemmed from disagreement over how quickly the team could become regular winners. ""The thing that really changed is I had a timeline in mind for changing the team, making it better,"" he said. ""I think some of the senior management at Renault had a shorter timeline in mind. ""If you can't reconcile that -- I think one thing, they think another -- it's best to part ways."" Famin said the changes were made ""in order to go faster in reaching the level of performance we are aiming for. ""Mutually we agreed to split our ways, and that’s it."" Szafnauer faced an early setback last year when Australian reserve Oscar Piastri refused the offer of a seat and joined McLaren for 2023 after double world champion Fernando Alonso announced a surprise move to Aston Martin. Laurent Rossi, the man who appointed Szafnauer, was replaced as chief executive of the Alpine brand on July 20 and reassigned to 'special projects' within the Renault group. Rossi warned in May he would make changes if performances did not improve, and said the buck stopped with Szafnauer. Famin was handed overall responsibility for all of Alpine's motorsport activities, including Formula One and world endurance, two weeks ago and Szafnauer reported to him. ""The reshuffle of the team is a decision of the top management, of course,"" said Famin. ""It's not something which has been decided from one day to another."" ""What is happening is the second stage of the Alpine rocket...it's not going backwards, it’s moving forwards."" Alpine, who want to be regular winners by 2026, were fourth overall last season and are now sixth. They have failed to score in their last two races. Williams said Fry, who has had senior roles at both McLaren and Ferrari, will start work on Nov. 1. ""His knowledge and experience will further strengthen the team's technical capabilities and pursuit of excellence as we build the next chapter of Williams,"" said principal James Vowles. ""Pat has been a core part of winning teams throughout his career, he is one of the most respected experts in our industry and I’m excited to begin work with him when he joins in November."""
"Exclusive: BYD tells India partner it wants to drop $1 billion EV investment plan, sources say",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/byd-tells-india-partner-it-wants-drop-1-bln-ev-investment-plan-sources-2023-07-28/,"NEW DELHI, July 28 (Reuters) - China's BYD (002594.SZ) has told its India joint-venture partner it would shelve plans for a new $1-billion investment to build electric cars after its investment proposal faced scrutiny from New Delhi, two people with knowledge of the discussions said. BYD and its partner, privately held Megha Engineering and Infrastructures submitted a proposal to the Indian government in April to jointly build electric cars in India, Reuters reported earlier this month. But in the initial review, officials from three Indian ministries, including finance and external affairs, raised what two Indian officials described as security concerns about investment from the Chinese company and signalled opposition. BYD executives told Megha Engineering last week that the battery and EV maker wanted to drop pursuit of the investment, according to the two people with knowledge of that exchange. It was not immediately clear whether BYD could have second-thoughts, and as of Thursday BYD had not formally withdrawn the investment proposal from government review, the two officials with knowledge of the review said. BYD, China's largest EV maker, declined to comment on the status of its investment proposal and whether it would pull the plan to produce electric cars in India. In a statement to Reuters, the company said it has had a presence in India for 16 years, selling both passenger cars and electric-drive buses. India's finance, external affairs and home ministry did not reply to an email seeking comment. Megha Engineering did not respond to request to comment. During a meeting last week, Hyderabad-based Megha Engineering urged BYD to wait for more clarity on the situation before moving to drop the electric cars manufacturing plan, according to the two people with knowledge of the discussion. BYD had understood its investment proposal would be politically charged because of the scrutiny of Chinese investment in India and had attempted to head off concerns, the two people with knowledge of its planning said. For instance, the proposal said voice-activated commands for apps would be available in Indian languages in BYD electric cars built in India and that all data from the vehicles would be housed in India, one of the people said. BYD had proposed starting production in India by 2025, the people familiar with the plan said. India began subjecting investment from China to closer scrutiny in 2020 amid a series of border clashes between the two countries. China's Great Wall Motor shelved its plans to invest $1 billion after failing to get clearances from the Indian government. A final decision on whether to approve BYD's investment proposal would be taken by Indian ministries of trade and heavy industries. BYD, the world's largest producer of EVs and plug-in hybrid vehicles, entered the Indian market in 2007 producing batteries and components for mobile phone makers. In 2013 it started building electric buses in India with Megha Engineering, under a joint venture company called Olectra Greentech (OLEC.NS). BYD, which has already invested over $200 million in India, markets the Atto 3 electric SUV and the e6 EV to corporate fleets and plans to launch sales of its Seal electric sedan later this year. BYD has sold about 1,950 cars in India since starting sales in 2022, according to government registration data. India's EV market is small but growing with domestic automaker Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) dominating sales. Electric models made up less than 2% of total car sales in 2022 but the government wants to grow this to 30% by 2030."
Lordstown Motors stalls on the road to a quick bankruptcy sale,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/lordstown-motors-stalls-road-quick-bankruptcy-sale-2023-07-27/,"NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - Bankrupt Lordstown Motors (RIDEQ.PK) must face trial over a rival carmaker's claim that Lordstown vehicles include stolen technology, a U.S. judge ruled Thursday, dealing a blow to the company's hopes for a quick bankruptcy sale. The automaker, named after the Ohio town where it is based, filed for bankruptcy in June and had asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath in Wilmington, Delaware, to approve bidding procedures that would allow the company to sell its assets by September. Walrath instead said a sale should not be expedited while a California court is weighing a lawsuit by a rival carmaker that raises questions about some of the assets Lordstown seeks to sell. California-based Karma Automotive sued Lordstown in 2020 for allegedly poaching its employees and stealing technology used in vehicle infotainment systems. That case had been scheduled for trial in September before being placed on hold by Lordstown's bankruptcy. ""The critical issue in this case is whether the debtors own the property that they want to sell,"" Walrath said at a court hearing. ""The California court ... should decide those issues."" Karma said it was pleased with the ruling allowing it to proceed to trial. The company has ""overwhelming evidence"" that Lordstown's Endurance electric pickup truck was developed using Karma's proprietary technology, a Karma spokesperson said. Lordstown did not respond to a request for comment. Walrath said Lordstown was not at risk of running out of cash before a sale or a California verdict, because it entered bankruptcy with over $130 million in cash and it owed only about $20 million to its top creditors. The September deadline ""appears to be designed solely to get this done before a Karma decision can be made in the California litigation,"" Walrath said. Walrath allowed Karma to proceed to trial on its claims against Lordstown, overruling bankruptcy protections that typically pause lawsuits against bankrupt companies. Because the lawsuit has been proceeding for three years, the California court is in a better position to rule on ""exactly what Karma may or may not own,"" she said. The judge said she intends to revisit Lordstown's proposed sale process in early August, taking a short delay to see whether it receives any initial bids by a July 31 deadline. In addition to the Karma dispute, Lordstown is also engaged in litigation against several other parties, including its former partner Foxconn and several investor groups."
"Stellantis tops forecasts, looks to cost cuts to keep margins strong",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-operating-profit-rises-11-h1-topping-forecasts-2023-07-26/,"MILAN, July 26 (Reuters) - Revenue and operating profit grew at Stellantis (STLAM.MI) in the first half to beat estimates, with CEO Carlos Tavares saying the automaker would have to accelerate cost cutting to keep profitability strong in a more challenging pricing environment. The world's third largest automaker by sales said on Wednesday its January-June adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose 11% to 14.1 billion euros ($15.6 billion), topping the 12.1 billion expected by analysts in a Reuters poll. New CFO Natalie Knight, who took the job this month, said pricing power was still the main driver for the results of the group whose brands include Fiat, Peugeot, Alfa Romeo, Ram and Jeep. ""We did a variety of price increases and the group has been outstanding at holding on to those, and also looking at where additional pricing was appropriate in the first half,"" she said. Milan-listed shares in Stellantis were up 2.5% by mid-morning, outpacing a 0.4% rise in Italy's blue-chip index (.FTMIB). Equita's analyst Martino De Ambroggi said that strong first half results, including for cash generation, would support an improvement of his forecasts for the group's full-year results, despite an expected pricing power reduction. U.S. electric car maker Tesla (TSLA.O) kicked off a round of price cuts in China in January, putting pressure across the board on automakers and suppliers to contain costs. Stellantis' margin on adjusted EBIT slipped to 14.4% from 14.5% a year earlier, when pricing power had been supported by a significant inflationary environment, Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said. ""If the market is more competitive in terms of pricing, we need to work harder on cost reduction to make sure that we give back to the market the breathing space it needs while protecting our per unit margins,"" he said. He argued that the Stellantis margin performance was still better than those of Tesla (TSLA.O) and GM (GM.N), which he said posted margins of 10.5% and 8.3% respectively. Its first-half EBIT margin fell 60 basis points to 17.5% in North America, the group's most profitable region. Stellantis, which shipped more vehicles in the first half also thanks to fewer logistic issues in Europe, confirmed its target for a double-digit margin for the full year. ($1 = 0.9038 euros)"
GM shares fall as automaker outlines new cost-cutting drive,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-puts-profit-ahead-growth-veering-away-tesla-2023-07-25/,"DETROIT, July 25 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM.N) is wrestling with costs and struggling to build more electric vehicles, as it reported Tuesday that adjusted pre-tax profit and margins in its key North American market fell from the first quarter, despite a jump in revenue and per-vehicle transaction prices. Shares were down 4.4% at $37.58 in mid-day trading. The automaker said it plans to invest less in new products and cut operating costs by an additional $1 billion through the end of next year, and lifted its full-year profit guidance. Chief Executive Mary Barra, in a call with analysts, said GM has reversed plans to kill its least expensive EV, the aging Chevrolet Bolt, at the end of this year. Instead, the company now expects to introduce an updated Bolt with a newer Ultium battery pack, but did not disclose details about cost, timing or plant location. ""A new Bolt should cost the same or less to produce than the outgoing model"" if it shifts to a dedicated EV platform and next-generation batteries, said Sam Fiorani, head of global forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. Barra said battery production at the Ultium joint venture plant in Lordstown, Ohio, has been hampered because ""our automation equipment supplier is struggling with delivery issues."" The situation should be resolved by year-end, Barra said. GM in the meantime is building battery modules by hand on manual assembly lines, she said. GM said adjusted pre-tax profit and margins in its key North American market fell from the first quarter, despite a jump in revenue and per-vehicle transaction prices. Second-quarter results included a $792 million charge related to new agreements with EV supplier partners LG Electronics and LG Energy Solution. On a year-to-year basis, GM said net income for the second quarter rose by nearly 52% to $2.6 billion, as revenue grew 25% from the same period in 2022 when production was hobbled by semiconductor shortages. GM said it now expects full-year net income of $9.3 billion to $10.7 billion, up from a previous forecast of $8.4 billion to $9.9 billion. On a per-share basis, GM is forecasting net income of $7.15 to $8.15 for the year, up from a range of $6.35 to $7.35. The new outlook does not factor in the potential costs of a strike by the United Auto Workers union should it fail to reach a new contract with GM by the Sept. 14 deadline. The UAW focused on GM's robust revenues and profits, mostly earned from union-made trucks, and a statement that called on GM to offer more in contract negotiations now under way. ""Auto workers and our communities have yet to be made whole for the sacrifices we’ve made since the Great Recession,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said. GM's more bullish outlook comes after six months of stronger demand and richer pricing than expected earlier this year, Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said during a media conference call. But the decision to cut new product investment and operating costs comes as the automaker's profit margins are under pressure. GM's pre-tax profit margin for the first six months of the year fell to 8.3% of revenue, down from 8.9% a year ago. GM now plans to spend $11 billion to $12 billion on capital investments this year, down from an earlier plan to spend $11 billion to $13 billion. ""There's a lot of focus on winning with simplicity,"" Jacobson said. Barra said GM can cut capital spending by simplifying its product line, reducing the number of different combinations of colors and features offered. GM's goal is to cut the number of feature and color trim combinations by half, Barra said. In contrast to Tesla (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk's strategy of cutting prices to accelerate demand, GM pushed average transaction prices in North America up by $1,600 to about $52,000 in the latest quarter, Jacobson said. ""We're focused on profitability. Our recent results demonstrate that we're not sacrificing margin for volume,"" he said. Barra, in a letter to shareholders, said the automaker is aiming to build ""roughly 100,000 EVs in the second half of this year and we’ll grow from there."" In the first half, GM built about 50,000 EVs, most of them the older Bolt model, which is priced from $27,495. GM's earnings statement reiterated a previous target of building 400,000 EVs from 2022 through the first half of 2024, and projected EV revenue of $50 billion in 2025, with pre-tax profit in the low to mid single digits. A Reuters analysis in May noted that a slow ramp-up of GM battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan could limit the automaker's annual EV production to less than 600,000 at mid-decade, even as GM aims to increase capacity to 1 million by 2025. In a note to investors, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said he remains ""cautious due to the near-term earnings drag from GM's EV transition and its ability to execute an aggressive production ramp, as well as ultimate demand for its EV models."""
Goodyear Tire to expand board in settlement with Elliott,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/goodyear-tire-add-three-directors-settle-with-elliott-2023-07-25/,"July 25 (Reuters) - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co (GT.O) said it would add three directors in agreement with Elliott Investment Management, months after the activist investor disclosed a stake and called for changes to strengthen the company's financial position. Elliott's investment announced in May made it one of Goodyear's biggest investors. The firm urged the company to refresh the board, sell its stores and conduct an operational review. On Tuesday, Goodyear said it would establish a strategic and operational review committee. The committee will be chaired by CEO Richard Kramer and will include two of the three new directors. The activist firm had proposed five new directors join the company's board. Elliott, which has a history of taking board seats at companies including Twitter and eBay, had previously criticized the tyre-manufacturer for mismanagement and lagging behind its rivals, Michelin and Bridgestone. ""We have been encouraged by Goodyear's openness to taking actions necessary to realize its full potential,"" Elliott executives said in a statement on Tuesday. Tyre-makers have come under pressure over the past few years from cheaper Chinese rivals and face scrutiny from regulators on concerns of tyre pollution. In its most recent quarter, Goodyear posted an adjusted quarterly loss of 29 cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of 30 cents. The Akron, Ohio-based company said it would nominate up to 12 directors for election at its annual meeting in 2024, including the three new directors. Evercore, Lazard and Goldman Sachs are financial advisers to Goodyear, while Paul Weiss the legal counsel. Goodyear's shares were largely flat in early trading after rising about 3% before the bell."
US appeals court to reconsider decision on Elon Musk tweet about unions,https://www.reuters.com/legal/appeals-court-reconsider-ruling-elon-musk-tweet-about-unions-2023-07-21/,"July 21 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday said it will reconsider its recent decision that Tesla (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk violated federal labor law by tweeting that employees would lose stock options if they joined a union. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans granted Tesla's request to revisit the case ""en banc,"" meaning that its 16 active judges will take part. A three-judge panel of the same court had in March upheld a National Labor Relations Board ruling that Musk's May 20, 2018 tweet was an unlawful threat that could discourage unionization at his electric car company, and must be deleted. Musk issued the tweet as the United Auto Workers sought to organize employees at Tesla's plant in Fremont, California. ""Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted,"" he wrote. ""But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?"" The appeals court panel found ""substantial evidence"" that the tweet was ""an implied threat to end stock options as retaliation for unionization."" In seeking reconsideration, Tesla cited free speech concerns, and said the NLRB ignored that no employees claimed that Musk was threatening them, that Musk did not intend to threaten anyone, and that Musk later clarified his tweet was not a threat. The NLRB did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Tesla and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests. A decision is unlikely before 2024. Twelve of the appeals court's 16 active judges were appointed by Republican presidents. Musk's use of Twitter has caused him trouble before, including when he tweeted in August 2018 about having ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. Musk did not, and he and Tesla each paid $20 million civil fines to settle a subsequent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit. Musk's $236.4 billion fortune makes him the world's second-richest person, according to Forbes magazine. He bought Twitter in October for $44 billion."
Dead EV batteries turn to gold with US incentives,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/dead-ev-batteries-turn-gold-with-us-incentives-2023-07-21/,"POOLE, England, July 21 (Reuters) - A little-publicized clause in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act has companies scrambling to recycle electric vehicle batteries in North America, putting the region at the forefront of a global race to undermine China's dominance of the field. The IRA includes a clause that automatically qualifies EV battery materials recycled in the U.S. as American-made for subsidies, regardless of their origin. That is important because it qualifies automakers using U.S.-recycled battery materials for EV production incentives. Reuters interviewed more than a dozen industry officials and experts who say that is kicking off a U.S. factory building boom, encouraging automakers to research more recyclable batteries, and could eventually make it harder for buyers in developing countries to buy old used EVs. China handles virtually all EV battery recycling in a global market projected to grow from $11 billion in 2022 to $18 billion by 2028, according to research firm EMR. As more EVs are introduced and age out of the vehicle fleet, that business will grow. The minerals in those batteries - primarily lithium, cobalt and nickel - are worth on average between 1,000 euros ($1,123) to 2,000 euros per car, BMW (BMWG.DE) sustainability chief Thomas Becker told Reuters. Those materials could be in short supply within a few years as automakers boost EV production, but ""can be recycled infinity times and not lose their power,"" said Louie Diaz, vice president at Canadian battery recycling firm Li-Cycle (LICY.N), which received a $375 million U.S government loan for a New York plant slated to open later this year. That funding helped bring forward the investment decision for the plant, Diaz said. JB Straubel, CEO of Redwood Materials, which was awarded a $2 billion U.S. government loan in February to build out a battery material recycling and remanufacturing complex in Nevada, said the IRA treats recycled battery materials as locally ""urban mined,"" or materials recovered from scrap rather than obtained from mining. That has encouraged U.S. companies to move faster on recycling efforts than their counterparts in the European Union, which has focused instead on mandates, including minimum amounts of recycled materials in future EV batteries. Recycling firms Ascend Elements, Li-Cycle and others are planning European plants in the next few years, but access to funding and the made-in-America incentive means several U.S. plants are already being built. ""What it (the IRA) does is change the demand equation for battery materials,"" said Mike O'Kronley, CEO of Ascend Elements, which already has one recycling plant open in Georgia and has received nearly $500 million in Energy Department grants under the infrastructure law for a plant in Kentucky slated to open in late 2023. ""We need to keep those valuable materials... so we can put them right back into EVs."" The race is on to build ""closed-loop supply chains"" where recycled minerals are put into locally produced new batteries, said Christian Marston, chief technology officer at Altilium Metals, which is building a plant in Bulgaria and plans one in the UK by 2026. ""Everybody wants to control their own supply chain and nobody wants to be reliant on the Chinese,"" he said. However, China still leads the race, announcing tougher standards and increased research support for recyclers last month. After passage last year of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, Chinese officials described the legislation as ""anti-globalization"" and accused the U.S. of ""unilateral bullying."" Globally, there are at least 80 companies involved in EV recycling, with more than 50 startups attracting at least $2.7 billion, virtally all in the last six years, from corporate investors including automakers, battery makers and mining giants like Glencore (GLEN.L), according to PitchBook.com data. The volume of EV batteries available for recycling should grow over tenfold by 2030, said consultant Circular Energy Storage. Around 11.3 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of batteries reached end of life in 2022, and that should rise to 138 GWh by 2030 - equivalent to roughly 1.5 million EVs - CES said. Electric vehicle batteries can last for 10 years or more. Some industry officials anticipate rapid growth means 40% of battery materials used in new EVs could come from recycled stocks by 2040. There is little existing U.S. recycling capacity today, and virtually none in Europe. At a facility in Poole in southern England, car breaker Charles Trent Ltd has built two lines where workers deconstruct wrecked or old vehicles to recycle everything. It has built special containers for EV batteries, which are sold for research or used by retrofitters electrifying fossil-fuel cars, partly because there is nowhere to recycle them. In Europe, EV batteries are currently shredded into ""black mass"" that is shipped to China for recycling. The race is on to squeeze the best price out of that black mass. ""The one who gets the highest yield at the lowest cost ... will win this game,"" said Bruno Thompson, CEO of Cambridge, England-based startup The Battery Recycling Company, which plans its first plant in 2024. Dallas, Texas-based Ecobat, which shreds batteries in Europe and the U.S. for recycling elsewhere, has improved its recovery process so around 70% of battery-cell lithium is available for recycling, said chief commercial officer Thea Soule. Eventually, Soule said, yields should reach levels close to 90% to 100%. Getting better yields matters because the EU will mandate minimum amounts of recycled lithium, cobalt and nickel in EV batteries within eight years. The EU will also impose tough conditions on recycling outside Europe. Those conditions will effectively keep recycling local, said Kurt Vandeputte, senior vice president at Belgian materials firm Umicore (UMI.BR). There are also industry concerns about finding old EVs for recycling. Today, anywhere up to 30% of Europe's old fossil-fuel cars disappear overseas - to new owners in developing countries or for scrap. Some automakers are trying to figure out how to keep tabs on those EVs. Nissan (7201.T) has turned to leasing EVs in Japan to maintain control of batteries, while Chinese EV maker Nio (9866.HK) leases batteries to customers to retain ownership. Keeping those minerals in Europe would cut off a cheaper source of transportation for developing countries. BMW's sustainability chief Becker said the value of battery materials will hopefully make recycling more attractive than selling vehicles abroad, but Europe must focus on ensuring those EV batteries do not slip away. ""We've got to make sure we lose nothing,"" Becker said. ($1 = 0.8902 euros)"
UAW seeks Washington backing to pressure Detroit Three automakers in labor talks,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-seeks-washington-backing-pressure-detroit-three-automakers-labor-talks-2023-07-21/,"WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain has made winning the support of Washington a key part of the union's strategy to nail down new labor deals with the Detroit Three automakers. Part of that approach includes a decision by the UAW to hold off on endorsing U.S. President Joe Biden's re-election campaign, in a move to pressure the administration, industry executives and analysts said. U.S. unions are making bolder contract demands in the tighter labor market. Fain, who represents 150,000 U.S. hourly workers at General Motors (GM.N), Ford Motor (F.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI), came to Washington on Wednesday, a day after opening talks with GM, to meet with lawmakers and make the case that the union's demands are reasonable. Fain gave a slide presentation to lawmakers as he argued workers' compensation has not kept up with the nearly $250 billion in North American profit raked in by the three automakers over the last decade. ""It's a very uneven playing field right now,"" Fain told Reuters on Wednesday after one meeting. ""Our workers have regressed. We've got to do better."" The Detroit Three automakers have said they want to compensate fairly their hourly workers, but also have stressed a need for greater cost competitiveness as the industry shifts to electric vehicles, a market dominated by Tesla (TSLA.O). ""The best way to provide job security for our 50,000 manufacturing employees is by keeping General Motors financially strong,"" GM manufacturing chief Gerald Johnson said in a video the automaker released on Wednesday on a website dedicated to the UAW talks. The Detroit Three automakers rely on representatives in Washington to lobby for their positions. Biden also faces pressure from former President Donald Trump, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. On Thursday, Trump said Biden was ""waging war on the U.S. auto industry"" through ""crippling"" EV mandates and urged the UAW to endorse him. Biden's campaign responded by saying Trump was ""the most anti-union president in modern history, stacking his cabinet with anti-union officials."" It added that under Biden, ""more than 120,000 auto manufacturing jobs have come back to the United States, and new auto factories are popping up across the country."" Meanwhile, Fain has not ruled out striking all three Detroit automakers. A strike of all three could have major economic impacts and Washington could come under heavy pressure to intervene. In 2019, GM's fourth-quarter profit took a $3.6 billion hit from a 40-day UAW strike that shut down U.S. operations. ""Some of the slides really show how much workers have back-slid while compensation for the top executives is continuing to increase,"" said U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat who took part in a labor caucus meeting with Fain. She said automakers cannot use an old formula to win labor deals by simply promising a new plant or employment. ""It can't just be more jobs in America. They need to be union jobs,"" Jayapal said. The UAW has made the fate of Detroit Three joint-venture battery plants a key focus. The automakers have emphasized that the unionization of those plants not wholly owned by the companies is up to the affected workers. Representative Donald Norcross, a Democrat from New Jersey, said workers across the economy need higher wages and benefits. ""They are going to get a big wake-up call,"" Norcross said of the Detroit Three. ""There's a reckoning that people ought to be able to take care of their families."" Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said the UAW is making the case that its goals are reasonable and that members will strike if they do not achieve them. This, he said, sets the stage ""for ways in which political leaders could exert pressure on the Detroit automakers, who need all kinds of things from the federal government."" Fain met White House officials on Wednesday to discuss the union's bargaining positions, including a brief meeting with Biden. Fain also met with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and fellow Democratic senators Dick Durbin, Sherrod Brown, Gary Peters, Debbie Stabenow and Bob Casey, as well as Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su, a union official said. Other meetings were scheduled for the rest of the week. Fain not only has broken with most major U.S. labor unions in not yet endorsing Biden for re-election, but has also panned some administration policies on electric vehicles. Last month, Fain harshly criticized the U.S. Energy Department plan to lend $9.2 billion to a joint venture of Ford and South Korea's SK Innovation (096770.KS) to build three U.S. battery plants, citing the lower wages paid to workers that are typically not union-represented. After a meeting with Fain in April, Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, criticized a GM-LG Energy Solution (373220.KS) joint-venture battery plant for paying workers much less than GM assembly plant employees even though GM benefits from hefty U.S. government tax credits. The same program funded Ford."
Analysis: Elon Musk and Tesla loom over Detroit's auto labor talks,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/elon-musk-tesla-loom-over-detroits-auto-labor-talks-2023-07-20/,"DETROIT, July 20 (Reuters) - Detroit's automakers and the United Auto Workers will not be alone as they begin bargaining this week over wages and working conditions that will govern the shift to electric vehicles over the next several years. Tesla (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk and the automaker's increasingly profitable and efficient electric-vehicle factories will be shadow participants, just as Japanese automaker Toyota (7203.T) and its lean production system were for much of the past 30 years. Tesla enjoys an operating-profit advantage over General Motors (GM.N) and Ford (F.N) that ranges from nearly $2,800 per vehicle for GM to $3,970 per vehicle for Ford, based on a Reuters analysis of financial results at each automaker. Stellantis' (STLAM.MI) North American operations last year out-earned all three in operating profit per vehicle, earning $8,365 per vehicle to beat Tesla's latest second-quarter figure by nearly $1,200. That is in part due to Stellantis North America's focus on combustion pickup trucks and Jeep SUVs that command hefty profit margins. Looking forward, Detroit Three executives say new contracts with the UAW must allow them to be ""competitive"" as their U.S. operations shift to building EVs, which are money-losers for the legacy automakers now. Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has warned a rapid shift to EVs forced by regulations is ""beyond the limits"" of what consumers can shoulder. Stellantis cited rising costs for moving to EVs when it announced plans to idle a Jeep factory in Belvidere, Illinois. The Detroit manufacturers are expected to bring comparisons with Tesla to the bargaining table, people familiar with the process said. ""Tesla today plays the role of the Japanese and German automakers in the '80s,"" said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the U.S. industry. UAW President Shawn Fain, in a statement on Wednesday, put his own interpretation on the term ""competitive."" ""As we embark on this EV journey,"" he said, ""we are constantly presented with the same tired script from the companies; that we must remain 'competitive,' which is nothing more than a continued race to the bottom in a quest to follow the lowest bidder to pay poverty wages."" Tesla's U.S. factory workers are not unionized. Musk fought an effort by the UAW to organize Tesla's Fremont, California, factory. He posted a tweet in 2018 warning that workers could lose stock options if they joined the union, an action the National Labor Relations Board later ruled illegal. Tesla workers earn about $45 an hour in wages and benefits, analysts said. That compares with about $64 to $67 an hour at UAW-represented Detroit Three operations. The automakers do not detail the hours of labor that go in to building their vehicles - and those figures vary based on the different levels of vertical integration. But using an estimate of about 30 hours of work to assemble a vehicle, Tesla would have a direct labor cost advantage of as much as $660 per vehicle over one of the Detroit Three. That gap helps Tesla's ability to offer more features in its vehicles at a given price, or to cut prices without going into the red. Hourly labor costs are just a slice of Tesla's overall superiority in EV profitability, an edge it is using to cut prices and gain share in the EV market. Musk's comment on Wednesday that he could have Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, doing useful work in factories next year is the least of Detroit's problems. Ford CEO Jim Farley has said Tesla enjoys a $2,000 advantage in distribution costs because it does not have dealers with whom it shares profit. Tesla also has pioneered use of large ""giga-castings"" to replace multiple parts with single, cast metal pieces that save on production equipment and assembly time. Tesla executives in March outlined plans to cut production costs by as much as half with what they call ""unboxed assembly,"" that could eliminate many of the steps on a traditional assembly line. During the second quarter, Tesla pulled in $150 million to $250 million in U.S. battery production subsidies, and enjoyed a similar amount in lower costs for lithium and battery materials, Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn said on Wednesday on a conference call. Taken together, Inflation Reduction Act production subsidies and battery material cost reductions boosted Tesla's second-quarter profit by $625 to $1,000 per vehicle, based on the company disclosures. Tesla earned $5,000 in operating income per vehicle for the second quarter, according to company disclosures. On a similar basis, Ford reported $3,220 per vehicle in the first quarter, while GM reported $4,400 per vehicle in overall pretax profit per vehicle for the first quarter. GM and Ford report second-quarter financial results next week."
"Trump, Biden campaigns spar over support of UAW workers, EV mandates",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-biden-campaigns-spar-over-support-uaw-workers-ev-mandates-2023-07-20/,"WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Thursday urged the United Auto Workers union to back his campaign, a day after the union's president met with President Joe Biden after raising concerns about electric- vehicle policies. Trump, the former Republican president seeking a return to office in 2024, said Democrat Biden was ""waging war on the U.S. auto industry"" through ""crippling"" electric vehicle mandates and urged the UAW to endorse him. Trump made the comments in a video posted on his social media platform, Truth Social. Biden's campaign responded that Trump was ""the most anti-union president in modern history, stacking his cabinet with anti-union officials."" It added that under Biden, ""more than 120,000 auto manufacturing jobs have come back to the United States, and new auto factories are popping up across the country."" Trump said he advocated trade policies to help U.S. autoworkers during his presidency, including renegotiating trade deals. Biden's campaign said that he supported incentives that helped dramatically add more U.S. electric vehicle and battery production. UAW President Shawn Fain, who represents 150,000 U.S. hourly workers at General Motors (GM.N), Ford Motor (F.N), and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI), has held off so far on endorsing Biden for re-election and has criticized some administration EV policies. Most other major unions have already endorsed Biden. The UAW said in May that ""another Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster. But our members need to see an alternative that delivers real results."" In his Truth Social post on Thursday, Trump vowed to ""terminate"" green vehicle mandates, warning that if they continued under Biden, ""American auto production will be totally dead."" Many congressional Republicans have also criticized Biden's electcric-vehicle rules, arguing they would force automakers to end gasoline-powered production. The trade group representing nearly all major automakers last month urged the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to ease its proposal to cut vehicle emissions through 2032, saying this approach was ""neither reasonable nor achievable."" The EPA said in April the proposed 2027-2032 standards would cut emissions by 56% and require 67% of new vehicles to be electric by 2032. Earlier this month the UAW called on the Biden administration to soften its proposed vehicle emissions rules. Fain said last week the UAW was not ready to endorse Biden. ""We have expectations and that's why we haven't made endorsements yet,"" he said. ""We expect people to be there for us if they want our endorsement."""

Otmar Szafnauer, the principal of the British-based Alpine Formula One team, reports to Famin who in turn had a direct report to Rossi. Rossi had made headlines at the Alpine F1 team when he warned in May he would make changes before the end of the season if performances did not improve, and said the buck stopped with Szafnauer."
Jaguar Land Rover appoints interim boss Mardell as CEO for three-year term,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/jaguar-land-rover-names-adrian-mardell-new-ceo-2023-07-20/,"BENGALURU, July 20 (Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), a unit of Indian automaker Tata Motors (TAMO.NS), said on Thursday it appointed interim boss Adrian Mardell as chief executive officer for a three-year term. Mardell, who has been with JLR for 33 years and became chief financial officer in 2019, transitioned to the interim CEO role last November when Thierry Bollore resigned due to personal reasons. The automaker also made acting CFO and former McLaren Automative finance chief Richard Molyneux's role permanent. Molyneux, who previously spent over six years as JLR's finance director of operations, was appointed acting CFO last December. The appointment of Mardell comes a day after Tata Group announced plans to build an electric vehicle (EV) battery plant in Britain to supply its Jaguar Land Rover factories. Mardell, a 62-year-old British national, will also be tasked with overseeing JLR's electrification plans after it announced in April it would invest 15 billion pounds ($19.28 billion) over the next five years in electric vehicles and promised to deliver a new electric Jaguar in 2025.

"Morning Bid: Tesla, Netflix underwhelm",https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/global-markets-view-usa-2023-07-20/,"A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan An overdue cold shower? July 20 (Reuters) - The first of the supercharged Big Tech firms to report in this earnings season - Tesla and Netflix - seemed to underwhelm markets overnight, cutting across the enthusiastic reception for big banks and knocking back bulled-up Wall St from 2023 highs. The price bar for the mega-cap indices (.NTFANG) that have near doubled this year may be sky high and a perhaps some rotation is overdue. But an impressive run for the S&P500 (.SPX) and Dow Jones (.DJI) benchmarks - where the latter clocked eight straight days of gains on Wednesday - looked set for a breather as futures stepped back 0.2% ahead of Thursday's open. Although electric car giant Tesla (TSLA.O) comfortably beat second quarter profit forecasts, markets seized on plans for continued price discounting and squeezed margins as a reason to drag its shares down almost 4% in overnight trading. Similarly, Netflix's bottom line also beat the Street and it added almost 6 million new subscribers as restrictions on account sharing kicked in - but its stock recoiled 9% ahead of the bell after quarterly revenue disappointed. Overseas, Taiwan's chipmaker giant TSMC (2330.TW) forecast a 10% drop in 2023 sales after reporting a 23% fall in second-quarter earnings as global demand stuttered. The stock price pullbacks seemed more of a recalibration of an overcooked sector, however, with bank shares by contrast (.SPXBK) advancing 1.70% on Thursday and gaining for a third straight session. Citizens Financial (CFG.N) and US Bancorp (USB.N) both jumped more than 6% on impressive earnings updates. With 10% of the S&P500 now having reported, 80% of those have beaten forecasts, according to Refinitiv data. But the 'blended' reported and estimated overall readout from the second quarter is now indicating an annual drop of 8.2% for the 500 firms compared to -5.7% earlier this month. Energy, Healthcare and Materials sectors are the biggest drag. Pharma and financials dominate Thursday's reports. There was also some cooling in the macro world - with U.S. housing starts falling back in June after the prior month's surge, even though building permits continued to advance smartly. In the fixed income world, Treasury yields crept back higher ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting. Rising wheat prices aggravated the food price picture after Russia attacked Ukraine's grain exporting ports following Moscow's withdrawal from the Black Sea export deal this week. Wheat rose another 2% to three-week highs, having gained 16% over the past 5 days, but remains down almost 10% on a year ago. Elsewhere, European shares advanced again - encouraged by disinflation signals in Britain and around the region. Chinese stocks continued their remarkable underperformance - with no interest rate cuts forthcoming yet to offset the spluttering recovery there, property sector worries mounting and geopolitical concerns high. The dollar (.DXY) backed off Thursday's highs. Events to watch for on Thursday: * U.S. corporate earnings: Abbott Laboratories, Johnson & Johnson, Blackstone, Capital One, Travelers, Truist Financial, Fifth Third, Marketaxess, American Airlines, Marsh & McLennan, Philip Morris, Newmont, Freeport-McMoRan, WR Berkley, CSX, DR Horton, Intuitive Surgical, PPG, Pool, KeyCorp, Snap-On * U.S. July Philadelphia Federal Reserve business survey, weekly jobless claims, June existing home sales.

"BASF China boss Kamieth leads race for new CEO, FT says",https://www.reuters.com/business/basf-china-boss-kamieth-leads-race-new-ceo-ft-says-2023-07-20/,"July 20 (Reuters) - Top BASF (BASFn.DE) China executive Markus Kamieth is leading the race to succeed Martin Brudermueller as CEO of the German chemicals giant, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. Kamieth oversees operations in Greater China, South and East Asia, ASEAN and Australia and New Zealand, according to BASF's website. Kamieth is said to be the clear favourite and is backed by Brudermueller, after Saori Dubourg, who headed BASF's European business, left the company in February, the FT report said. A person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named, told Reuters BASF chief technology officer Melanie Maas-Brunner was still a possible candidate alongside Kamieth. The source added the supervisory board led by former BASF CEO Kurt Bock would pick a successor at the beginning of October at the earliest. A BASF spokesperson said there has been no decision yet on Brudermueller's succession, declining to comment further. Both Kamieth and Maas Brunner support BASF's focus on investment in China, which runs counter to German government efforts to persuade companies to reduce their reliance on China. Brudermueller, whose contract runs until April 2024, has been a driving force behind a 10 billion euro ($11.21 billion) chemical complex that BASF has started building in Zhanjiang, southern China, as it banks on booming Asian markets and seeks to reduce reliance on weak European home markets. Dubourg, an executive board member since 2017, quit BASF this year because she did not support the company's commitment to China given rising tensions between Asia's superpower and the West, sources have told Reuters. The Zhanjiang project is one of BASF's two major investment projects. The other is the build-up of a global supply of electric vehicle battery materials. Brudermueller, who has been CEO of BASF since 2018, was chosen in May to take over as head of the supervisory board of Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) next year. Earlier this month, BASF cut its full-year earnings forecast, becoming the latest chemical company to be caught out by weak demand from industrial clients and higher interest rates.

Fain, who was on Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers to discuss the labor talks and the union's push for higher wages and benefits, has not yet endorsed Biden for re-election and has criticized some administration electric vehicle policies. Most other major unions have already endorsed Biden. The UAW leadership had asked for time to brief White House senior staff on the Detroit Three contract negotiations, a White House official said. That meeting took place on Wednesday in the West Wing, and when Biden learned of it, he asked to also talk directly with Fain and the two had a brief meeting, the official added. Last month, Fain harshly criticized the U.S. Energy Department plan to lend $9.2 billion to a joint venture of Ford Motor (F.N) and South Korea's SK On to build three U.S. battery plants. Asked about his message for Biden on how he could boost auto workers given the federal incentives, Fain said: ""We just really discussed what options are out there. We just have to see where things go."" Fain said last week the UAW was not ready to endorse Biden. ""We have expectations and that's why we haven't made endorsements yet. We expect people to be there for us if they want our endorsement,"" he said. Fain was in Washington in April and met with White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients. Fain, who represents 150,000 U.S. hourly workers at General Motors (GM.N), Ford and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI), has not ruled out striking all three U.S. automakers if new contracts are not reached by the Sept. 14 deadline. Fain told lawmakers what members were seeking in new contracts. He said the Detroit Three had earned nearly $250 billion in profit over the last decade in North America. ""It's a very uneven playing field right now,"" Fain said. ""Our workers have regressed. We've got to do better."" Fain said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares did not attend the opening of contract talks last week and Stellantis' chief operating officer for North America, Mark Stewart, was late. ""The fact that Tavares couldn't even show up for the beginning of bargaining, the most critical set of negotiations in this company's history, is shameful,"" Fain said. Stellantis said Tuesday in response that it believed the opening session with the UAW ""went well and we intend on continuing to approach these discussions in a respectful manner."" The UAW said in a memo Wednesday that during the opening of talks with GM the day before that the union made clear the Sept. 14 contract expiration ""is not a suggestion, it is a deadline."""
"US, Mexico agree on labor rights plan for Mexican Goodyear plant",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/mexico-announces-reparation-plan-local-goodyear-plant-2023-07-19/,"MEXICO CITY, July 19 (Reuters) - The United States and Mexico reached an agreement to remedy violations of workers' rights at a Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co (GT.O) plant in the Mexican city of San Luis Potosi, both countries said on Wednesday. The Mexican government has committed to carry out a number of measures under the agreement, the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office said in a statement. The measures include having Goodyear distribute and enforce a sector-wide labor contract, award additional wages and benefits to those eligible and give backpay for ""Goodyear's failure to apply"" the contract previously, the USTR added. Goodyear must also inform workers of their labor rights and respect union activity, the USTR said. Mexico will carry out periodic inspections of the plant, and if warranted, could impose sanctions on people, labor organizations or the company, the USTR said. The two countries set a deadline of Jan. 19, 2024, to complete remediation proceedings, it added. Mexico's labor ministry will continue to carry out a review of companies in the rubber industry and their labor agreements, it said in a separate statement with the economy ministry. The remediation plan comes after a petition from a Mexican independent union, which found Goodyear was offering employees fewer benefits than an industry-wide agreement required."
Tesla to hand over Musk's emails to JPMorgan in lawsuit over 2018 tweet,https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-hand-over-musks-emails-jpmorgan-lawsuit-over-2018-tweet-2023-07-19/,"NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) will get to review some of Elon Musk's emails as it pursues a lawsuit against Tesla (TSLA.O) over a bond contract dispute that arose after Musk tweeted he might take his electric car company private. In a Wednesday hearing in Manhattan federal court, U.S. Magistrate Judge Ona Wang gave Tesla four weeks to turn over emails from Musk's account at his rocket manufacturing company SpaceX, to allow JPMorgan enough time to prepare for witness interviews. The largest U.S. bank says Musk communicated through the SpaceX account about taking Tesla private, an idea Musk floated in August 2018 by tweeting he had ""funding secured"" for a possible buyout though none was close. JPMorgan plans to depose Musk in December, Tesla lawyer Nathan Goralnik said at the hearing. ""SpaceX is not an alter ego of Mr. Musk, but we don't expect there to be any issue getting those documents produced,"" Goralnik said. JPMorgan sued Tesla for $162.2 million in November 2021, saying Tesla breached a 2014 contract related to stock warrants it sold to the bank, and which JPMorgan believes became more valuable because of Musk's tweet. Warrants give the holder the right to buy a company's stock at a set ""strike"" price and date. JPMorgan said it was obligated to reprice the warrants after Musk's notorious tweet, and that a subsequent ten-fold increase in Tesla's stock price required that company to make payments, which it has not done. Tesla countersued JPMorgan in January, accusing the bank of seeking a ""windfall"" when it re-priced the warrants. A federal jury in San Francisco in February found Musk and Tesla not liable for misleading investors with the tweet. Musk, who bought Twitter last year for $44 billion, agreed in a 2018 deal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to get preapproval from a Tesla lawyer for some tweets. A federal appeals court is considering his bid to end that agreement."
Volkswagen convinced Xinjiang audit will provide insight on human rights situation,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-convinced-xinjiang-audit-will-provide-insight-human-rights-situation-2023-07-19/,"BERLIN, July 19 (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) said it remained intent on commissioning an independent audit of its Xinjiang plant in China and was convinced that doing so would provide valuable insight, after some investors and activists criticised the mechanism as ineffective. The United Nations and rights groups estimate that more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a series of camps in Xinjiang and used for low-paid and coercive labour. China denies any human rights abuses in the western region. ""We are absolutely holding onto our intent [to run the audit],"" Volkswagen said in response to an open letter sent by the Association of Ethical Shareholders Germany to the carmaker on the topic earlier in July. ""In contrast to you, we are convinced that an audit by an independent auditor can deliver important information about the human rights situation at the Urumqi plant,"" the statement, published on the website of the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, added. The shareholder association, which represents small investors on environmental, social and governance issues, had asked Volkswagen in its letter how it would ensure results were independent given heavy-handed censorship in the region and China's anti-espionage laws. The carmaker did not directly address these concerns in its response, but said human rights were a key part of its behavioural code of conduct and that it adheres to the UN guiding principles for business and human rights. ""We have agreed high standards with our social partners at the Volkswagen Group which are mandatory,"" it said."

Exor will partner with Impala, which is managed by French businessman Jacques Veyrat, the co-founder of TagEnergy, through a new joint holding company, which will become TagEnergy's largest single shareholder, the statement said. No financial details of the deal were disclosed. The investment marks Exor's first foray into the clean electricity production sector. Portugal-based TagEnergy specialises in building and operating energy projects, as well as providing energy storage and grid stabilisation services. ""Partnering with Exor will enable us to further support TagEnergy's ambition to expand in multiple regions across the globe and finance the promising projects the TagEnergy team is currently developing"", Veyrat said. TagEnergy, which has a portfolio of projects across Australia, the United Kingdom and Europe, aims to reach 5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable assets by 2027. Exor is the single largest investor in carmaker Stellantis (STLAM.MI) and the controlling shareholder in companies including luxury sports car maker Ferrari (RACE.MI) and Serie A soccer team Juventus (JUVE.MI)."
Volkswagen's efforts to boost valuation stifled by lack of succession plan,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagens-efforts-boost-valuation-stifled-by-lack-succession-plan-2023-07-19/,"HAMBURG/BERLIN, July 19 (Reuters) - As Volkswagen regears its strategy around boosting stock market value, investors warned its efforts would be wasted if it does not address the elephant in the room: the lack of a succession plan for its supervisory board. The market needs to know who will take over when the octogenerian heads of its controlling shareholder - the Porsche-Piech family clan - retire, according to Deka, Union Investment and DWS, three of the carmaker's top 20 shareholders. The company plans to run a series of capital market days in coming months for each of its brands, which it hopes will boost a valuation in freefall since mid-2021. When their strategy presentation at the company's capital markets day in June failed to impress investors - shares fell 2.5% on the day - company representatives said future capital market days would turn it around. But multiple sources were sceptical they would, unless Volkswagen's governance issues were addressed. The listing of luxury carmaker Porsche AG (P911_p.DE) in September would have been an opportune time to hand over power, Hendrik Schmidt, corporate governance expert at DWS (DWSG.DE), the asset management arm of Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) said. ""We have asked repeatedly for a long-term oriented transition plan for the supervisory board and encouraged a generational change,"" Schmidt said. ""The share is suffering from a 'governance discount',"" said Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at Volkswagen shareholder Deka Investment. To be sure, other issues also weigh on Volkswagen's stock market performance, from high capital costs and risks in China to concerns over its ability to maintain market dominance in an electric age. ""On almost every criteria, investors have a better alternative to invest in within the autos sector than Volkswagen,"" said Arndt Ellinghorst of Quantco. Wolfgang Porsche and Hans Michael Piech, both above 80, are the two oldest successors of the Porsche and Piech families which founded the Volkswagen Group. The two men sit on the boards of both Volkswagen and Porsche SE (PSHG_p.DE), the holding company which owns 31.9% of Volkswagen and has 53.3% voting rights, essentially controlling Europe's largest carmaker. ""If a brick falls on my head, the question of a successor is taken care of,"" Wolfgang Porsche said in a recent interview with Stuttgarter Zeitung, without providing further details. Still, the families are aware of the need for clarity, a source close to the matter said, declining to be named, with the next generation waiting in the wings. One possible successor as head of the Porsche family is 62-year-old Ferdinand Oliver Porsche, currently on the board of Porsche SE, Volkswagen, Audi, and Porsche AG. ""Oliver Porsche is sure to represent and take over from Wolfgang Porsche at some point,"" the source said. On the Piech side, 29-year-old Sophie Piech and her brother Stefan Piech, 52, are both possible candidates as successor to the role of Piech family head, the source said. ""It's not ideal that it takes so long,"" the source said. Beyond the issue of the succession plan, analysts have pointed to weaknesses in the board's neutrality and qualifications. Eight out of ten members are direct representatives of the three biggest shareholders in Volkswagen: the Porsche and Piech families, Lower Saxony, or Qatar. Four are lawyers and one has no professional qualifications, analyst Daniel Schwarz of Stifel pointed out in a recent report, limiting the extent to which they would be able to advise management on issues like digitalization and electrification. ""When you compare the situation at VW with other businesses, VW comes off badly,"" said Schwarz, pointing to Mercedes-Benz's board where multiple members have experience in chemistry, software, and luxury goods."
Tesla directors pay $735 mln to settle lawsuit over excess compensation,https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-directors-settle-lawsuit-over-compensation-735-mln-2023-07-17/,"WILMINGTON, Delaware, July 17 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (TSLA.O) directors will return $735 million to the company to settle claims they grossly overpaid themselves in one of the largest shareholder settlements of its kind, according to a Monday filing in a Delaware court. The settlement resolves a 2020 lawsuit by a retirement fund which holds Tesla stock and challenged stock options that were granted to Tesla directors starting in June 2017. The settlement does not impact the $56 billion compensation package of Elon Musk, which is being challenged by shareholders in a separate lawsuit that went to trial last year. A ruling is expected soon in the Musk case. The directors, including Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, agreed to return the equivalent value of 3.1 million Tesla stock options, according to a court filing. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. The directors acted in good faith and in the best interests of Tesla stockholders but agreed to settle to eliminate the risk of litigation to themselves and to the company, according to a court filing. The directors were accused of awarding themselves unfair and excessive compensation in the form of around 11 million stock options from 2017 to 2020 that the allegedly grossly exceeded norms for a corporate board. The case was brought by the Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit in 2020 and the settlement is paid to Tesla to benefit the company, a type of case known as a derivative lawsuit. The settlement is one of the largest ever for a derivative case in the Court of Chancery, a major venue for shareholder litigation. Tesla and Musk have a reputation for fighting lawsuits. Musk has prevailed at trial in a defamation lawsuit, a case accusing him of securities law violations and a shareholder lawsuit accusing him of coercing Tesla into buying SolarCity. As part of the settlement, the directors also agreed to not receive any compensation for 2021, 2022 and 2023 and the board will change the way compensation is determined. Tesla had defended against the lawsuit by arguing that the company went through almost unprecedented growth, sending the company's stock price up 10-fold. Along with that gain in stock value, stock options awarded to the directors and to Musk rose sharply in value. Tesla had argued it used the stock options to ensure the incentives of directors were aligned with the goals of investors."
Tesla sues Australia's Cap-XX over EV battery technology,https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-sues-australias-cap-xx-over-ev-battery-technology-2023-07-17/,"July 17 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O)sued Australian company Cap-XX in Texas federal court on Friday, claiming its supercapacitors used for storing energy in electric-vehicle batteries infringe two U.S. patents owned by a Tesla subsidiary. Tesla CEO Elon Musk pledged in 2014 not to ""initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology."" The company says the legal action comes in response to a lawsuit that Cap-XX originally filed against Tesla subsidiary Maxwell Technologies in 2019 for patent infringement. ""Maxwell has a history of innovation that has resulted in its own patents, now assigned to Tesla, and thus Tesla brings this suit against Cap-XX to protect its intellectual property rights,"" the lawsuit said. Representatives for Tesla and Cap-XX did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Tesla acquired Maxwell in 2019. Like Cap-XX, Maxwell makes capacitors for electric vehicles that increase their energy-storage capabilities. The patents that Cap-XX allegedly infringed relate to electrodes used in supercapacitors, which Tesla called the ""primary source of the device's power capabilities."" Tesla said the electrodes used in Cap-XX's supercapacitors work in the same way as Maxwell's patented technology. It asked the court for an unspecified amount of money damages. Cap-XX's ongoing lawsuit in Delaware federal court accuses Maxwell of infringing its own supercapacitor patents."
German union calls for better staffing at Tesla plant amid expansion plans,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-union-calls-better-staffing-tesla-plant-amid-expansion-plans-2023-07-17/,"FRANKFURT, July 17 (Reuters) - Germany's top union IG Metall on Monday called for Tesla to improve staffing conditions at its German gigafactory as it prepares to expand, with the carmaker due to publish its expansion plans for feedback from the community later this week. Tesla's (TSLA.O) application to double the capacity of its Gruenheide site to 1 million cars a year will be made accessible online and to local residents from July 19, according to the environment ministry of Brandenburg, the German state where the plant is based. Citizens have until mid-September to file objections to the application. The expansion plans will entail adding more jobs to the 12,000 planned for the first expansion phase of Tesla's first European product hub, of which roughly 11,000 have been hired so far. ""We welcome the creation of jobs in the automotive industry in Germany. Tesla's plans are a clear commitment to Brandenburg as a location,"" IG Metall's Dirk Schulze said. ""However, this announcement is in stark contrast to what the local employees are currently experiencing: Despite high levels of sick leave, staff are being cut on a considerable scale."" Schulze said that in June alone, around 200 permanent staff had been laid off or signed payout deals and a mid-triple digit number of temporary workers had been let go, without reducing the site's weekly production goal of 5,000 cars currently. ""Before the expansion of the plant, the expansion of the working conditions of the colleagues in Gruenheide must now finally have priority."" Tesla was not immediately available for comment. Tesla last month said it no longer needed as many temporary workers at Gruenheide as it did in its ramp-up phase and would refrain from Saturday shifts, but was still on track to achieve its production targets."
Fisker to sell limited edition electric SUVs in India by fourth quarter,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/fisker-sell-limited-edition-electric-suvs-india-by-fourth-quarter-2023-07-17/,"July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. startup Fisker (FSR.N) said on Monday it would produce 100 limited edition electric sports utility vehicles (SUVs) for the Indian market and expects to begin deliveries in the fourth quarter this year. The company had said in September it would begin selling its Ocean electric SUVs in India by July 2023, with local production beginning in a few years. But it now expects to complete the final checks for the SUV, named Fisker Ocean Extreme Vigyan, for India by the end of September, with its pricing aligning with the European market. Fisker Ocean Extreme is priced at 69,950 euros ($78,588.83), excluding taxes, in Germany. That would equate to around 6.45 million Indian rupees. A Fisker Ocean SUV starts at $37,499 in the United States. Electric vehicles (EVs) make up just 1% of the 3 million cars sold each year in India, with the government wanting to increase this share to 30% by 2030. For this, the country has introduced several incentives, including tax breaks for consumers. In India and across all regions outside China, the U.S. and Europe, EV sales are expected to represent 2%-3% of car sales in 2023, a relatively small yet growing share, according to data from International Energy Agency. Fisker has a secondary office in Hyderabad, India, and has about 100 employees in the country, according to its LinkedIn page. The California-based company has a contract manufacturing agreement with Magna International (MG.TO), which would produce the Ocean at its Austrian unit and ship it to India. Fisker also looks to produce its next EV, the smaller, five-seater PEAR in India with Foxconn (2317.TW). ($1 = 0.8901 euros) (1 Indian rupee = 0.0108 euros)"
"Exclusive: BYD proposes $1 billion India plan to build EVs, batteries",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/byd-seeks-nod-1-bln-plan-build-evs-batteries-india-sources-2023-07-14/,"NEW DELHI, July 14 (Reuters) - China's BYD Co (002594.SZ) has submitted a $1 billion investment proposal to build electric cars and batteries in India in partnership with a local company, three people with direct knowledge of the plan told Reuters. BYD and privately held Hyderabad-based Megha Engineering and Infrastructures have submitted a proposal to Indian regulators to form an EV joint venture, the people said, asking not to be named because the application is private. The longer-term plan is to build a full line-up of BYD-brand electric cars in India from hatchbacks to luxury models, one of the three people said. BYD, the world's largest producer of EVs and plug-in hybrid vehicles, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company previously said it planned to set up manufacturing in India, now the world's third-largest car market. India's commerce and heavy industries ministries did not immediately reply to a request for comment. BYD's push into India is part of its rapid global expansion to challenge Tesla (TSLA.O), which still leads in sales of EVs alone. If the India investment is approved, it would give BYD a presence in all major global car markets with the exception of the United States. Tesla has recently restarted talks with India's government after putting on hold plans to enter the market last year when it failed to secure lower tax duties on imported vehicles in talks with officials. BYD has already invested $200 million in India where it sells the Atto 3 electric SUV and the e6 EV to corporate fleets, and plans to launch its Seal luxury electric sedan this year. The total production capacity proposed by BYD was not immediately clear. The maker of Blade batteries as well as finished EVs has plans to scale up to production of 100,000 EVs annually in India over a few years but would likely begin by shipping vehicles in parts for assembly in the country as it works to build up a supply chain, one of the sources said. The investment proposal also includes a plan by BYD and Megha Engineering to set up charging stations in India and build research and development and training centres, the sources said. The joint proposal comes amid stricter investment rules. Since 2020, India has tightened scrutiny of investments from neighbouring countries, including China. Those controls forced China's Great Wall Motor (601633.SS) to shelve a plan to invest $1 billion in the Indian market and pushed Chinese state-owned automaker SAIC's (600104.SS) MG Motor unit to look for a local partner. Shenzhen-based BYD entered the Indian market in 2007 producing batteries and components for mobile phone makers. In 2013 it started building electric buses with Megha Engineering, under a joint venture company called Olectra Greentech (OLEC.NS). BYD, which stands for Build Your Dreams, sold a total of 1.86 million BEVs and plug-in hybrids in 2022. In India, EVs made up just over 1% of total car sales of 3.8 million in 2022 but the government wants to grow this to 30% by 2030. In India, BYD will compete with domestic automaker Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) and Chinese rival MG Motor that currently dominate electric car sales."
Elon Musk launches AI firm xAI as he looks to take on OpenAI,https://www.reuters.com/technology/elon-musks-ai-firm-xai-launches-website-2023-07-12/,"July 12 (Reuters) - Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur, launched his long-teased artificial intelligence startup xAI on Wednesday, unveiling a team comprised of engineers from the same big U.S. technology firms that he hopes to challenge in his bid to build an alternative to ChatGPT. The startup will be led by Musk, already the CEO of electric car maker Tesla (TSLA.O), CEO of rocket launch company SpaceX and owner of Twitter, who has said on several occasions that the development of AI should be paused and that the sector needed regulation. Musk has repeatedly voiced concerns about AI's potential for ""civilizational destruction."" In a Twitter Spaces event Wednesday evening, Musk explained his plan for building a safer AI. Rather than explicitly programming morality into its AI, xAI will seek to create a ""maximally curious"" AI, he said. ""If it tried to understand the true nature of the universe, that's actually the best thing that I can come up with from an AI safety standpoint,"" Musk said. ""I think it is going to be pro-humanity from the standpoint that humanity is just much more interesting than not-humanity."" Musk also predicted that superintelligence, or AI that is smarter than humans, will arrive in five or six years. Musk co-founded OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, in 2015, but stepped down from the company's board in 2018. Microsoft is an investor in OpenAI. The websitefor xAI said it will hold a Twitter Spaces event on July 14. The team at xAI includes Igor Babuschkin, a former engineer at Google's DeepMind; Tony Wu, who worked at Google <GOOGL.O>; Christian Szegedy, who was also a research scientist at Google; and Greg Yang, who was previously at Microsoft. Musk in March registered a firm named X.AI Corp, incorporated in Nevada, according to a state filing. The firm lists Musk as the sole director and Jared Birchall, the managing director of Musk's family office, as a secretary. Musk had said in April that he would launch TruthGPT, or a maximum truth-seeking AI to rival Google's Bard and Microsoft's (MSFT.O) Bing AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe. Generative AI caught the limelight with OpenAI's launch of popular chatbot ChatGPT, which came in November last year, ahead of the launch of Bard and Bing AI. Dan Hendrycks, who will advise the xAI team, is currently director of the Center for AI Safety and his work revolves around the risks of AI. Musk's new company is separate from X Corp, but will work closely with Twitter, Tesla and other companies, according to the website. xAI said it is recruiting experienced engineers and researchers in the San Francisco Bay Area."
"Germany more flexible on hydrogen transition, emphasises speed - draft",https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/germany-more-flexible-hydrogen-transition-emphasises-speed-draft-2023-07-12/,"FRANKFURT, July 12 (Reuters) - Germany is set to hold on to its hydrogen economy goals up to 2030 and beyond while pressing for speed and allowing greater leeway in transitioning from fossil fuels-based variants to renewables, a draft paper showed on Wednesday. Europe's biggest economy wants to produce, import and market clean hydrogen, derived from carbon-free wind and solar power, as a future energy source to meet climate targets and lessen dependency on imported raw materials. The draft was seen by Reuters while being presented to the national hydrogen council prior to assessment and adoption by the Berlin cabinet. It will become a 2023 strategy update guiding stakeholders in production, transport and wholesale markets as well as infrastructure investors. The paper spoke of ""further speeding the necessary market ramp-up of hydrogen through concrete and tightened measures"". The coalition government in 2021 installed a target of 10 gigawatts (GW) of green hydrogen production by 2030, which can receive direct financial support, doubling previous ambitions. The paper said hydrogen needs integrating into gas transport grids, for which there will have to be 1,800 kilometres of converted and new pipelines to be developed from 2024/25 and in place by 2027/2028. These lines would receive partial support under Europe's important projects of common interest (IPCEI) schemes and embedded within trans-European hydrogen grids amounting to 4,500 km. Germany's hydrogen demand in 2030 is pegged at 95-130 terawatt hours (TWh), of which 50%-70% will have to be imported, with separate provisions due to be made. European energy bourse EEX in May started publishing a green hydrogen index, scaling up price discovery, among many budding, complementary initiatives. There would be greater tolerance of fossil- and nuclear-derived hydrogen, partly with carbon sequestration until such time as renewables could fully meet hydrogen demand, Germany's draft paper said. Environmentalist hardliners reject all forms of non-green varieties, describing them as a lifeline for fossil fuel incumbents."

The company, which had raised going-concern doubts last year, appointed outsider Jonathan Maroko as its new interim chief financial officer, effective July 24. Maroko replaces Yun Han, who will transition to the role of chief accounting officer. Faraday Future also said its annual report for 2022, quarters ending September 2022 and March 2023 ""should no longer be relied upon"" due to certain errors. The errors were related to fair value conversion of certain notes it had issued. The company will file restated financial statements and the move will not affect its vehicle delivery timeline, it added. Faraday Future has been struggling with a cash crunch and a governance dispute with one of its largest shareholders, FF Top Holding, which resulted in a board reshuffle. Last month the company secured $90 million funding commitment from existing investors and had in May announced plans to raise $100 million in debt. The latest developments at Faraday come weeks after peer EV start-up Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy protection, even as some other EV firms grapple with demand challenges and a price war sparked by market leader Tesla (TSLA.O) early this year."

Volkswagen faces fresh investor doubts on independence of planned Xinjiang audit,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-faces-fresh-investor-doubts-independence-planned-xinjiang-audit-2023-07-11/,"BERLIN/HAMBURG, July 11 (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) was challenged by an investor association on Tuesday about the planned audit of its co-owned site in Xinjiang, China, adding to concerns raised by human rights activists that the measure would be ineffective. The Association of Critical Shareholders (DKA), which represents small investors on environmental, social and governance issues, asked Volkswagen in an open letter how it would ensure results were independent given China's anti-espionage laws. It highlighted restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on international auditors, including the raid of U.S. corporate auditor Mintz Group's offices in Beijing and reports China instructed state-owned enterprises to stop using PwC, EY, KPMG and Deloitte. ""We therefore see a very high risk that the Chinese government will misuse the audit for its international disinformation campaign to conceal the actual conditions at the plant,"" the DKA wrote. Volkswagen did not comment on the specific questions in the letter, referring to its previous statement that it plans to carry out an independent audit this year and is in talks with joint venture partner SAIC on the matter. SAIC (600104.SS) declined to comment. The United Nations and rights groups estimate that more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a system of camps in Xinjiang and used for low-paid and coercive labour. China denies any human rights abuses in the western region. Volkswagen said at its capital markets day in June it would carry out an independent audit of the site it jointly owns with Chinese state-owned enterprise SAIC in Urumqi, after investors called on the company to do so."
GlobalFoundries scraps plan to appoint former top Amazon executive as CFO,https://www.reuters.com/technology/globalfoundries-scraps-plan-appoint-former-top-amazon-executive-cfo-2023-07-11/,"July 11 (Reuters) - Chipmaker GlobalFoundries (GFS.O) has shelved its plan to appoint former Amazon executive Tim Stone as chief financial officer, it said on Tuesday, two months after choosing him. The company, which did not disclose the reason in its statement, declined a Reuters request for further comment. It said current CFO David Reeder will remain in the role through the end of the year as it looks for a new candidate. GlobalFoundries had in May named Stone, who was at Amazon (AMZN.O) for more than 20 years and served as CFO for AWS and Devices businesses. He has also been the finance chief of Ford Motor (F.N) and Snap (SNAP.N). The chipmaker counts companies including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), STMicroelectronics (STMPA.PA), Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) among its customers. It forecast second-quarter revenue below estimates in May as demand from consumer electronics market remained weak. Global PC shipments fell 13.4% during the second quarter, according to IDC."
IEA says critical minerals supply could pull close to demand by 2030,https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/iea-says-critical-minerals-supply-could-pull-close-demand-by-2030-2023-07-11/,"LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - Supply of minerals critical to the energy transition could move close to levels needed to support climate pledges by 2030 after a surge in investment, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday - provided all projects go as planned. Consultants and analysts have warned of looming shortages due to surging demand for key minerals like lithium and cobalt used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and other clean energy technologies. But after investment in critical minerals production jumped 30% last year to $41 billion, having gained 20% in 2021, that picture is looking brighter, the IEA said. In key battery mineral lithium, the IEA forecasts supply by 2030 will reach 420,000 metric tons - only a touch short of demand estimated at 443,000 to meet government pledges, though well below the 702,000 required for net zero. ""We are happy that for a change we can give some good news,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol told Reuters in an interview. ""This is testimony that the markets are buying in to the fact that the clean energy transition is moving very fast."" Critical mineral start-up firms raised a record $1.6 billion in 2022, up 160% from the previous year, the IEA said. Demand for critical minerals has surged over the past five years, including a tripling in consumption of lithium and a jump of 70% for cobalt, with the total critical mineral market now worth $320 billion, it said. While the supply picture is improving, the Paris-based energy watchdog warned that delays and cost overruns for projects posed a risk to the upbeat scenario. More work is also needed to diversify from key nations that have tight control on output of many minerals, such as China, Indonesia and Congo, the IEA added in a report. The newly financed projects will help meet rising demand for critical minerals that the IEA has calculated will be needed to meet climate pledges made by governments, which would likely result in a global temperature rise of 1.7 C by 2100. The agency made separate estimates of what would be necessary to meet a net zero-emission scenario by 2050. Mining companies needed to make more progress in curbing greenhouse gas emissions and water use, the IEA said. Twenty top miners emitted 0.18 kg of CO2 per kg of minerals in 2021, the same as in 2020, while water use climbed to 7.9 cubic metres per metric ton of mined output in 2021 from 5.4 cubic metres in 2019, the IEA said."
"BASF China boss Kamieth leads race for new CEO, FT says",https://www.reuters.com/business/basf-china-boss-kamieth-leads-race-new-ceo-ft-says-2023-07-20/,"July 20 (Reuters) - Top BASF (BASFn.DE) China executive Markus Kamieth is leading the race to succeed Martin Brudermueller as CEO of the German chemicals giant, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. Kamieth oversees operations in Greater China, South and East Asia, ASEAN and Australia and New Zealand, according to BASF's website. Kamieth is said to be the clear favourite and is backed by Brudermueller, after Saori Dubourg, who headed BASF's European business, left the company in February, the FT report said. A person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named, told Reuters BASF chief technology officer Melanie Maas-Brunner was still a possible candidate alongside Kamieth. The source added the supervisory board led by former BASF CEO Kurt Bock would pick a successor at the beginning of October at the earliest. A BASF spokesperson said there has been no decision yet on Brudermueller's succession, declining to comment further. Both Kamieth and Maas Brunner support BASF's focus on investment in China, which runs counter to German government efforts to persuade companies to reduce their reliance on China. Brudermueller, whose contract runs until April 2024, has been a driving force behind a 10 billion euro ($11.21 billion) chemical complex that BASF has started building in Zhanjiang, southern China, as it banks on booming Asian markets and seeks to reduce reliance on weak European home markets. Dubourg, an executive board member since 2017, quit BASF this year because she did not support the company's commitment to China given rising tensions between Asia's superpower and the West, sources have told Reuters. The Zhanjiang project is one of BASF's two major investment projects. The other is the build-up of a global supply of electric vehicle battery materials. Brudermueller, who has been CEO of BASF since 2018, was chosen in May to take over as head of the supervisory board of Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) next year. Earlier this month, BASF cut its full-year earnings forecast, becoming the latest chemical company to be caught out by weak demand from industrial clients and higher interest rates.

UAW president meets with Biden as union opens automaker contract talks,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-president-meets-with-biden-union-opens-automaker-contract-talks-2023-07-19/,"WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers (UAW) President Shawn Fain met on Wednesday with President Joe Biden at the White House as the union briefed staff on contract talks with the Detroit Three automakers. Fain, who was on Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers to discuss the labor talks and the union's push for higher wages and benefits, has not yet endorsed Biden for re-election and has criticized some administration electric vehicle policies. Most other major unions have already endorsed Biden. The UAW leadership had asked for time to brief White House senior staff on the Detroit Three contract negotiations, a White House official said. That meeting took place on Wednesday in the West Wing, and when Biden learned of it, he asked to also talk directly with Fain and the two had a brief meeting, the official added. Last month, Fain harshly criticized the U.S. Energy Department plan to lend $9.2 billion to a joint venture of Ford Motor (F.N) and South Korea's SK On to build three U.S. battery plants. Asked about his message for Biden on how he could boost auto workers given the federal incentives, Fain said: ""We just really discussed what options are out there. We just have to see where things go."" Fain said last week the UAW was not ready to endorse Biden. ""We have expectations and that's why we haven't made endorsements yet. We expect people to be there for us if they want our endorsement,"" he said. Fain was in Washington in April and met with White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients. Fain, who represents 150,000 U.S. hourly workers at General Motors (GM.N), Ford and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI), has not ruled out striking all three U.S. automakers if new contracts are not reached by the Sept. 14 deadline. Fain told lawmakers what members were seeking in new contracts. He said the Detroit Three had earned nearly $250 billion in profit over the last decade in North America. ""It's a very uneven playing field right now,"" Fain said. ""Our workers have regressed. We've got to do better."" Fain said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares did not attend the opening of contract talks last week and Stellantis' chief operating officer for North America, Mark Stewart, was late. ""The fact that Tavares couldn't even show up for the beginning of bargaining, the most critical set of negotiations in this company's history, is shameful,"" Fain said. Stellantis said Tuesday in response that it believed the opening session with the UAW ""went well and we intend on continuing to approach these discussions in a respectful manner."" The UAW said in a memo Wednesday that during the opening of talks with GM the day before that the union made clear the Sept. 14 contract expiration ""is not a suggestion, it is a deadline."""
"US, Mexico agree on labor rights plan for Mexican Goodyear plant",https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/mexico-announces-reparation-plan-local-goodyear-plant-2023-07-19/,"MEXICO CITY, July 19 (Reuters) - The United States and Mexico reached an agreement to remedy violations of workers' rights at a Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co (GT.O) plant in the Mexican city of San Luis Potosi, both countries said on Wednesday. The Mexican government has committed to carry out a number of measures under the agreement, the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office said in a statement. The measures include having Goodyear distribute and enforce a sector-wide labor contract, award additional wages and benefits to those eligible and give backpay for ""Goodyear's failure to apply"" the contract previously, the USTR added. Goodyear must also inform workers of their labor rights and respect union activity, the USTR said. Mexico will carry out periodic inspections of the plant, and if warranted, could impose sanctions on people, labor organizations or the company, the USTR said. The two countries set a deadline of Jan. 19, 2024, to complete remediation proceedings, it added. Mexico's labor ministry will continue to carry out a review of companies in the rubber industry and their labor agreements, it said in a separate statement with the economy ministry. The remediation plan comes after a petition from a Mexican independent union, which found Goodyear was offering employees fewer benefits than an industry-wide agreement required."
