# Supply-chain-mapping

The COVID-19 pandemic underscored global supply chain vulnerabilities, exemplified by shortages in microchips, toilet paper, and personal protective equipment. Post-pandemic, companies face challenges due to limited knowledge of deeper supply chain tiers. While demand for transparency increases, obstacles like confidentiality concerns and global complexities hinder information sharing. This paper explores the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as lemmetization, lowercasing, and tokenization to pre-process the dataset text for the purpose of supply chain mapping post- COVID-19. Initially, relevant textual data is collected and preprocessed to eliminate noise and standardize the information. Subsequently, Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques are applied to identify entities like company names, product names, and locations within the text. These identified entities serve as the foundation for the subsequent analysis. NLP aids in extracting insights from textual sources, enabling comprehensive supply chain relationship mapping. The paper details the integration of NLP tools for unstructured data searching, addressing issues such as sourcing verification, environmental changes, and ethical practices. Initially, relevant textual data is collected and preprocessed to eliminate noise and standardize the information. Subsequently, Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques are applied to identify entities like company names, product names, and locations within the text. These identified entities serve as the foundation for the subsequent analysis. Graph representation forms the core of supply chain mapping using NLP. Entities are depicted as nodes, and relationships are denoted as edges in the graph. This visualization simplifies the intricate connections and facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the supply chain network.
